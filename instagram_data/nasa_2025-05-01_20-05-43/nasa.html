When the cameras on NASA‚Äôs New Horizons spacecraft first spotted the large reddish polar region on Pluto‚Äôs largest moon, Charon, mission scientists knew two things: they‚Äôd never seen anything like it elsewhere in our solar system, and they couldn‚Äôt wait to get the story behind it.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Turns out Pluto is something of a graffiti artist ‚Äì methane gas escapes from Pluto‚Äôs atmosphere, becomes ‚Äútrapped‚Äù by Charon‚Äôs gravity, and freezes to the cold, icy surface at the moon‚Äôs pole. When it‚Äôs springtime on Charon, the returning sunlight triggers the frozen methane to change back into gas, which leaves behind heavier chemical compounds. Sunlight further irradiates those leftovers into reddish material that has slowly accumulated on Charon‚Äôs poles over millions of years.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
The image combines blue, red, and infrared images taken by New Horizons‚Äô Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC); the colors are processed to best highlight the variation of surface properties across Charon. New Horizons was the first spacecraft to explore Pluto up close. In early 2019, New Horizons flew past its second major science target ‚Äì Arrokoth, the most distant object ever explored up close.‚Å£

Image description: Pluto‚Äôs largest moon, Charon, is gray with a jagged line of fractures and canyons going across it diagonally. There are many craters visible, especially on the bottom and right sides. At the top, in a region informally named Mordor Macula, Charon is a deep, rusty red.‚Å£

‚Äâ
Messier 17, also known as the Omega Nebula or Swan Nebula, is one of the largest star-forming regions in the Milky Way galaxy. In this image by @NASAHubble, the central portion of the nebula has been colorized to highlight certain wavelengths of light. Green represents oxygen, while red reveals hydrogen and infrared light. ‚Äâ
‚Äâ
The Swan Nebula is located 5,500 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius and is home to one of our galaxy‚Äôs youngest star clusters. The young stars in this cluster are difficult to see because of the gas and dust that surrounds them. The powerful radiation from the young stars evaporates and erodes the dense clouds of cold gas in which new stars form. ‚Äâ

This mesmerizing view of concentric light circles is a star trail: a photograph that shows stars‚Äô apparent motion over time in the night sky. NASA astronaut Don Pettit made this composite image combining 18 30-second-long exposures (that is, he left the camera shutter open for half a minute for each photo) taken while aboard the @ISS in 2012.‚Å£
‚Å£
The space station travels at a speed of five miles per second (8 km per s), orbiting Earth about every 90 minutes. In 24 hours, the crew aboard see 16 sunrises and sunsets. The orbital lab‚Äôs unique viewpoint and speed make it perfect for observations of Earth, allowing astronauts to take photos of our home planet, its atmosphere, and natural disasters.‚Å£
‚Å£
Image description: In this composite photo made of long exposures, stars make concentric circles of blue and white light in space. Below, Earth is blue with lines of yellow light streaking across it. Earth‚Äôs atmosphere is orange here, with a thin green border. Also visible at top is part of the Japanese Experiment Module Exposed Facility.‚Å£

Actually, the Lunar Roving Vehicle was 10 feet (3.0 m) long and 7.5 feet (2.3 m) wide ‚Äî roughly the size of a small car ‚Äî but in this photo, it's dwarfed by Plum Crater, which is nearly 130 feet (40 m) in diameter. 

Apollo 16 astronauts John W. Young and Charles M. Duke drove the lunar rover to Plum Crater on April 21, 1972, to collect samples; this photo of Duke was taken by Young, the mission commander. "Big Muley," a 26-pound (11.7-kg) rock collected by Young and Duke on the rim of Plum Crater, was the largest single sample brought back from the Moon during the entire Apollo program. 

Today, we're preparing for #Artemis II, which will send humans around the Moon in 2026 for the first time in over 50 years. Follow @NASAArtemis for the latest mission updates!

Image description: A deep lunar crater stretches off the left edge of this photo; its very bottom is shrouded in shadow. On the far side of the crater, the white, boxy Lunar Roving Vehicle can be faintly seen, with a bright lens flare above and to the right. An astronaut in their spacesuit is standing on the right side of this photo, facing the camera, with an L-shaped lunar sampling tool in their left hand.

The Cygnus Loop (also known as the Veil Nebula) is a supernova remnant, left over from a massive stellar explosion that occurred 5,000 to 8,000 years ago. The original supernova would have been bright enough to be seen clearly from Earth with the naked eye. At three degrees across, the Cygnus Loop is as wide as six full moons in the night sky.

This image is a combination of X-ray data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and optical data by amateur astronomer John Stone ‚Äî but the @NASAChandraXray team has also just released a new 3D visualization of the Cygnus Loop. It visualizes how the blast wave from the explosion interacts with an isolated cloud of the interstellar medium (that is, dust and gas in between the stars). You can view that 3D model and others like it at nasa.gov/chandra.

Image description: In the composite image, the remnant resembles a wispy cloud in oranges, blues, purples, and whites, shaped like a backwards letter C. The remnant is set against a backdrop of scattered stars.

      <div class='list-caption'>One telescope. Nearly 1.7 million observations. Thirty-five years ‚Äì and counting.‚Äâ
‚Äâ
In celebration of the Hubble Space Telescope‚Äôs April 24 launch anniversary, we‚Äôre sharing new images from the famous observatory.‚Äâ
‚Äâ
From within our home solar system, to stunning nebulae found in interstellar space, to a far-flung galaxy, these anniversary images are a reminder of Hubble‚Äôs impact on every area of astronomy.‚Äâ
‚Äâ
Since its launch in 1990, the Hubble mission has fundamentally changed the way we understand our universe. Its impactful discoveries and iconic images make it a scientific and cultural icon.‚Äâ
‚Äâ
Hubble‚Äôs powerful and unique vision ‚Äì spanning ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared wavelengths ‚Äì continues to unlock cosmic mysteries. In fact, its astronomical achievements have resulted in over 22,000 scientific papers and over 1.3 million citations as of February 2025.‚Äâ
‚Äâ
At 35 years old, Hubble remains a scientific powerhouse. Here‚Äôs to more discovery ahead!‚Äâ

      <div class='list-caption'>He came. He saw. He took really great pictures.This weekend, Don Pettit will return to Earth after his 7-month mission to the International Space Station (@ISS). Throughout his stay, @astro_pettit contributed to research that benefits humanity and supports future space missions.Pettit also shared what he calls his ‚Äú‚Äùscience of opportunity‚Äù‚Äù to demonstrate how experimenting with our surroundings can help gain a better understanding of how things work. This understanding is enhanced when art, science, and microgravity come together. 

Check out a few of Don‚Äôs many photos.

Image descriptions: 
1. Comet C2024-G3 soars through space as pictured from the ISS. The lower half of the photo glows blue from Earth‚Äôs atmosphere; the top half contrasts with the blackness of space. 2.

      <div class='list-caption'>That‚Äôs one speedy spud ü•î‚Å£
‚Å£
@NASAHubble took 13 separate exposures over 22 minutes to create this time-lapse image of tiny, potato-shaped moon Phobos (at left) orbiting around Mars. Phobos is so small that it looks like a star in these Hubble photos.‚Å£
‚Å£
This little tater is fast, though: Phobos orbits Mars in just 7 hours and 39 minutes, which is faster than Mars rotates. The moon‚Äôs orbit is very slowly shrinking, meaning it will eventually ‚Äì as in, 50 million years from now ‚Äì break up under Mars‚Äô gravitational pull, or crash onto the planet.‚Å£
‚Å£
Poor little Phobos has already been battered: it was nearly shattered by a giant impact, and has gouges from thousands of meteorite impacts.‚Å£
‚Å£
Here are a few more fun facts about Phobos:‚Å£
- It has no atmosphere.‚Å£
- It‚Äôs the larger of Mars‚Äô two moons. The other moon is called Deimos.‚Å£
- The fine dust on Phobos‚Äô surface cannot retain heat.‚Å£
‚Å£
Image description: Tiny moon Phobos travels behind Mars in this image. The moon appears multiple times, since this is a time-lapse photo. Phobos is a small silvery dot here. Mars dominates the photos. Mars is mostly red-orange, with dark blotches and silvery wisps all around its edges.‚Å£

A planetary nebula located just 4,600 light-years away in the Milky Way galaxy puts on a spectacular display at the end of a giant star's life. The image itself was the final work of one of @NASAHubble's instruments: the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). First installed in 1993, the WFPC2 was replaced in 2009 by the Wide Field Camera 3 during Hubble‚Äôs final servicing mission.

The swirling, paint-like clouds in the darkness of space are clouds of ionized atoms thrown into space by a dying star. Its red giant star had exhausted its available fuel and shed its last layers of gas, enabling nuclear fusion as its compact core begins to contract further. The exposed core reaches extremely hot temperatures, radiating ultraviolet light that energizes the enormous clouds of gas cast off by the star. 

In this image, red and orange indicate nitrogen, green is hydrogen, and blue shows oxygen. The spectacle is bittersweet, as the brief phase of fusion in the core will end after only tens of thousands of years, leaving a white dwarf that will never illuminate the clouds around it again.

Image description: A glowing, jagged ring encircles a small central region of greenish clouds, making it appear like a hole torn in fabric. This ‚Äúhole‚Äù is itself encircled by a band of silvery-blue clouds and a larger, fainter, yellow ring of gas. Puffy, smoky clouds of orange and red gas billow out from there into a large oval nebula, fading into the dark background of space dotted by stars.

For nearly 25 years, @NASAAstronauts have been living and working aboard the International Space Station. Some have only stayed for a few days, while some have lived in space for over a year at a time. (Astronaut Frank Rubio holds the NASA record, with a 371-day stay.) Some have traveled to the @ISS several times, while some are making their first visit‚Äîlike NASA's Nichole Ayers, seen here opening the hatch to the station's Kibo laboratory. Ayers launched to the station on NASA's SpaceX Crew-10 mission, which lifted off from @NASAKennedy on March 14.

The International Space Station is an orbiting laboratory, built to help us learn how to live in space while making life better back on Earth. We work with crew members and researchers from around the world to study human health, medicine and biology, materials research, Earth science and countless other scientific disciplines. (Visit nasa.gov/iss-research for more info.) Now, we're working with commercial partners on a new generation of space stations, making space more accessible and affordable as we send humans to the Moon and Mars.

Image description: Astronaut Nichole Ayers floats above a large, circular hatch in the International Space Station. She is looking down at the hatch and wearing a crimson long-sleeved shirt; her blond hair floats above her head. The hatch is hinged open to reveal the circular doorway into the station's Kibo laboratory; behind her, the walls of the station are mostly white panels, with a few cords and pieces of hardware.

Apollo 13 astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert launched from @NASAKennedy on April 11, 1970. They were headed to the Fra Mauro region of the Moon for the third lunar landing ever. Everything seemed to be going smoothly until the third day of the mission, when an oxygen tank ruptured and Swigert uttered those famous words: ‚ÄúHouston, we‚Äôve had a problem here.‚Äù

The new mission plan was to abandon the Moon landing, loop around the Moon, and get the crew home safely as quickly as possible. The crew needed to go into ‚Äúlifeboat mode,‚Äù using the lunar module Aquarius to save the spacecraft and crew. The Apollo 13 crew took this photo of the Moon from the lunar module as they passed by.

On April 17, the crew returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa. The Apollo 13 mission is sometimes called a ‚Äúsuccessful failure‚Äù: Though the crew couldn‚Äôt achieve their scientific goals, the rescue mission was a huge victory for NASA. The lessons learned from Apollo 13 were rapidly applied to the remaining Apollo missions and continue to guide us at NASA today.

      <div class='list-caption'>For 20 years, @NASAHubble has been studying Uranus... and learning more about its gas.

Uranus' atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane‚Äîbut that methane gives Uranus its distinctive cyan color. Our orbiting Hubble telescope studied Uranus between 2002 and 2022 and found that unlike other gas giants, Uranus has much less methane near its poles. 

Hubble also tracked complex circulation patterns in the planet's atmosphere, giving scientists a deeper look into Uranus.

This classic image of Uranus was taken not by Hubble, but by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft as it flew by the planet on Jan. 14, 1986.

      <div class='list-caption'>Sculpted by luminous stars üåü‚Å£
 ‚Å£
The dazzling, young stars in this cluster are artists: with the intense radiation and fierce stellar winds they produce, they sculpted the glowing pink nebula and snakelike dark clouds you see here.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
This star cluster is in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way that lies 200,000 light-years away in the constellation Tucana. It has been studied before by @NASAWebb and @NASAHubble, but this image includes new data and is the first to combine Hubble observations made at infrared, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths into an intricately detailed view of this vibrant star-forming factory.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
This ‚Äúartists collective‚Äù contains more than 2,500 newborn stars. The cluster‚Äôs most massive stars, which are many times more massive than our Sun, blaze with an intense blue light in this image. Hubble was instrumental in uncovering the secrets of how these stars formed. Using two sets of observations taken 11 years apart, researchers traced the stars‚Äô motions and found that they were spiraling in toward the center of the cluster. This spiraling motion comes from a stream of gas from outside of the cluster that fuels star formation in the center of the turbulent cloud.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: Bright blue stars curve gently toward the center of the image. Nestled around, in front of, and behind the clustered stars are large arcs of dense, reddish-brown dust. Thin, pale-blue wisps of clouds fill the background while denser areas of pinkish clouds appear stacked upon the wispier clouds. Thousands of orange stars are visible in the background behind the clouds of the nebula.‚Å£

On February 7, 1984, astronaut Bruce McCandless II became the first human in history to go on a spacewalk without a connection to their spacecraft. McCandless soared outside the space shuttle Challenger with the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), a propulsion device on the back of his spacesuit that used two tanks of hydrogen and 24 nozzles to move him around. 

In this iconic photo, taken by Challenger pilot Hoot Gibson, McCandless was just a few meters away from the shuttle, but further MMU flights by McCandless and astronaut Robert L. Stewart took them more than 300 feet (91 meters) into space. The MMU was used for several more flights in the 1980s. Today's @NASAAstronauts now wear SAFER (Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue), a smaller, simpler thruster system, in case they accidentally become untethered on a spacewalk.

Image description: An astronaut, wearing a full spacesuit and a large backpack, floats above Earth. Earth's blue seas and thin white clouds arc over the bottom half of this image; the astronaut is just above Earth's curvature. From the perspective of the photograph, he is leaning approximately 45 degrees to the right.

      <div class='list-caption'>Status: It‚Äôs complicated.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
@NASAWebb captures a rare cosmic phenomenon in this new image, called an Einstein ring. What may look like one strangely-shaped galaxy is actually two galaxies separated by a large distance. The closer galaxy sits at the center of the image, while the more distant background galaxy appears to be wrapped around the closer galaxy, forming a ring.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Now, stay with us here ‚Äî the light from the more distant galaxy is being bent (or lensed) by the closer, massive galaxy. This is possible because spacetime, the fabric of the universe itself, is bent by mass. Therefore, the light traveling through space and time is bent, as well. While too subtle to observe on smaller scales, the astronomical proportions allow us to observe the curvature of light.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Only at the perfect alignment ‚Äî between the lensed object and the lensing object ‚Äî can this distinctive Einstein ring shape be seen.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: In the center is an elliptical galaxy, seen as an oval-shaped glow around a small bright core. Around this is wrapped a broad band of light, appearing like a spiral galaxy stretched and warped into a ring, with bright blue lines drawn through it where the spiral arms have been stretched into circles. A few distant objects are visible around the ring on a black background.‚Å£

When an aircraft goes supersonic (about 760 miles an hour, or 1220 kph, at sea level), it sends shockwaves through the air, rapid pressure changes which are responsible for the sonic boom you may hear on the ground.
 
This photo was taken by a @NASA aircraft in 2019‚Äîthe first flight ever to capture interacting shockwaves from two supersonic aircraft. Images like these are helping us design our @NASAAero X-59 aircraft, which aims to fly at supersonic speeds without creating loud sonic booms. X-59 is currently gearing up for its first flight later this year.
 
Image description: Two jet planes, seen from below, fly through a bright blue background. Dark lines, indicating the path of their shockwaves, extend at trailing angles from the jets, with bright red trails visible very close to the jets. This image was originally monochromatic and is shown here as a colorized composite.

 ‚Å£
About 5,550 light-years away in our galaxy, there‚Äôs a magical light show going on. This region is a cluster of clusters, containing at least three clusters of young stars, including many hot, massive, luminous stars. These hot, young stars emit radiation, which energizes the cooler gas in the cloud that surrounds them.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Astronomers call this object and others like it ‚ÄúHII‚Äù (pronounced ‚ÄúH-two‚Äù) regions. An HII region is created when the radiation from hot, young stars strips away the electrons from neutral hydrogen atoms in the surrounding gas to form clouds of ionized hydrogen, which is denoted scientifically as ‚ÄúHII.‚Äù Scientists study these areas with telescopes like @NASAChandraXray because young stars are bright in X-rays. Also, X-rays can penetrate the shrouds of gas and dust surrounding these infant stars, allowing astronomers to see how stars are formed with details that would be otherwise missed.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
This composite image contains X-ray data from our Chandra X-ray Observatory and the ROSAT telescope (purple), infrared data from our Spitzer Space Telescope (orange), and optical data from the SuperCosmos Sky Survey (blue) made by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: This region looks like purple and blue drops of paint layered between streaks of orange and blue. There is color almost everywhere, though the blackness of space can be seen on the outer edges of the image. Stars are scattered all over; three shining stars nearly in a vertical line in the middle of the image stand out the most. There are bubbles, or cavities, that have been created by radiation and material blowing away from the surfaces of massive stars.‚Å£

‚Å£
@NASAWebb treated us to a sweet perspective: Herbig-Haro 49/50‚Äîa towering swirl from a nearby protostar‚Äîis (coincidentally) topped with a multi-hued spiral galaxy.‚Å£
‚Å£
Herbig-Haro objects are outflows produced by jets launched from a nearby, forming star. The outflows, which can extend for light-years, plow into a denser region of material. This creates shock waves, heating the material to higher temperatures. The material then cools by emitting light at visible and infrared wavelengths.‚Å£
‚Å£
The galaxy that appears, by chance, at the tip of this cosmic soft-serve is a much more distant, face-on spiral galaxy. It has a prominent central bulge represented in blue, filled with older stars. The bulge also shows hints of ‚Äúside lobes,‚Äù suggesting that this could be a barred spiral galaxy. Reddish clumps within the spiral arms show the locations of warm dust and groups of forming stars.‚Å£
‚Å£
Image description: This cosmic image is dominated with billowing clouds of orange-red gas, rich in detail. At the tip of the cloud, a spiral galaxy is visible, with a concentrated blue center that fades outwards to blend in with red spiral arms. The black background is speckled with some white stars and some smaller, fainter, and more detailed galaxies in shades of white and blue.‚Å£

      <div class='list-caption'>Galactic neighbors: close enough to wave, too far to visit (for now)‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Say hello to one of our Milky Way‚Äôs closest neighboring galaxies, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The dwarf galaxy is located about 200,000 light-years away, which makes it close enough to be visible from Earth without the help of a telescope or binoculars. For viewers in the Southern and some latitudes in the Northern hemisphere, the SMC resembles a piece of the Milky Way that has broken off ‚Äî though it is much farther away than any part of our own galaxy.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
In this image, we can see SMC in higher detail than what we would be able to see with our own eyes. This is thanks to @NASAHubble‚Äôs Wide Field Camera, which was used by astronomers to observe the galaxy through four different filters. Each filter permits different wavelengths of light, creating a multicolored view of dust clouds drifting across a field of stars. Here, Hubble is zoomed in on a small region of the SMC, to a star cluster that is home to dozens of massive young stars.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: An area of space filled with stars. Most of the stars are small, distant dots in a range of orange colors; closer stars shine with a bright glow and hold four thin diffraction spikes around them. These closer stars appear both bluish and reddish. Clouds from a nebula cover the left half of the scene, giving it a blue-greenish cast. More clouds also drift over the black background of space on the right side of the image.‚Å£

      <div class='list-caption'>Your screen isn't fuzzy‚Äîyou're looking at planets 130 light-years away.

Exoplanets, or planets beyond our solar system, are so small that we usually detect them by measuring the effect they have on their star: they may cause the star to wobble a bit, or make it a little less bright as they pass in front of it. But our @NASAWebb telescope is so powerful that it can spot, not just distant stars, but the much smaller worlds that orbit them. 

The HR 8799 star system has long been of interest to astronomers for what it can tell us about how planets form, and Webb is giving us a better look at it than ever. Not only are we getting a direct look at these four gas giants, Webb's data tells us that these worlds are rich in carbon dioxide, suggesting that they formed similarly to Jupiter and Saturn in our home system.

Image description: Four fuzzy planets are scattered across a black background in this annotated photo. Each planet has a letter and dashed line next to it, indicating the planet's name. To the left is a dark blue dot, which is HR 8799 b. A larger periwinkle dot is HR 8799 c; below is the gold dot of HR 8799 e; and at the bottom is the white dot of HR 8799 d. At the center, the star HR 8799 is denoted by a white, five-pointed star graphic.

      <div class='list-caption'>Cosmic bubble gum‚Å£ ü´ß
 ‚Å£
This candy-colored confection is a planetary nebula nicknamed the Little Gem Nebula. Located 6,000 light-years away from us in the constellation of Sagittarius, this Little Gem has a rather interesting shape ‚Äì and that‚Äôs thanks to the way it was made.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
When stars like the Sun enter ‚Äúretirement,‚Äù they shed their outer layers into space to create glowing clouds of gas called planetary nebulae. This ejection of mass is uneven, and planetary nebulae can have very complex shapes. The Little Gem took on the shape of a bright, enclosed central bubble with filament-like structures surrounded by a more diffuse bubble.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Scientists believe that the stellar wind from the central star propels the outward-flowing material, sculpting the nebula‚Äôs elongated shape. As this fast wind smashes through the slower-moving cloud, it creates particularly bright blowouts at the bubble‚Äôs outer layers.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: The Little Gem Nebula looks like two blue and purple cloudy bubbles, with bright streaks of red in the middle and on the outer edges. There is a bright dot near the center of the nebula. The rest of the image is black.‚Å£

On March 13-14, 2025, the Earth passed directly between the Sun and the Moon. Earth cast its shadow, turning the Moon‚Äôs typically gray and cratered surface red, aka a ‚ÄúBlood Moon.‚Äù‚Å£
 ‚Å£
While @NASAGlenn was looking up, @fireflyaerospace‚Äôs Blue Ghost lunar lander was looking back. Blue Ghost saw Earth block the Sun. From that perspective, this celestial event was a solar eclipse. It created a striking ‚Äúdiamond ring‚Äù effect in the sky.‚Å£

 ‚Å£
Our PUNCH and SPHEREx missions shared a ride aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which launched from California‚Äôs Vandenberg Space Force Base on March 11 at 11:10 p.m. EST (March 12 0310 UTC).‚Å£
 ‚Å£
While these missions went to space on the same rocket, their objectives are very different! ‚Å£

SPHEREx will survey the sky in optical and infrared light, gathering data on more than 450 million galaxies as well as 100 million stars in our own galaxy. Every six months, SPHEREx will scan our entire sky to create a map in 102 color bands.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
The PUNCH mission will use four suitcase-sized satellites to observe the Sun and its environment. Located in low Earth orbit, the satellites will work together to make 3D observations, studying how the Sun‚Äôs corona turns into solar wind and its influence on space weather.‚Å£

Video description: This video opens with a clip of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket soaring into the night sky over Vandenberg Space Force Base, followed by glowing plumes of smoke. The next clip shows the white, conical SPHEREx spacecraft slowly drifting off into space forward from the rocket, while Earth can be seen on the upper right corner. The final two clips show two of the PUNCH spacecraft moving away to the left and right, with Earth in the background.‚Å£

 ‚Å£
This composite picture of the Helix Nebula combines images from @NASAHubble and the National Science Foundation's 0.9-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory to give us a dizzying view down a trillion-mile-long tunnel of glowing gases. Because this radiant tube is pointed nearly directly at Earth, it looks more like a circle or bubble than a cylinder.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Look closely around the circle, and you may notice thread-like structures pointing toward the center. These filaments formed when a hot "stellar wind" of gas plowed into colder shells of dust and gas ejected previously by the small, super-hot white dwarf star at the center of this nebula.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Like Hubble, you too can study the Helix Nebula. It can be seen with binoculars as a ghostly, greenish cloud in the constellation Aquarius. If you have a larger amateur telescope, you‚Äôll be able to see the ring-shaped nebula, but only the largest ground-based telescopes will show the bicycle-spoke-like streaks.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: The Helix Nebula looks like a ring of red gas, with thousands of filaments circling the ring, pointing inwards toward the central star. There is blue gas in the center. The radiant colors correspond to glowing oxygen (blue) and hydrogen and nitrogen (red).‚Å£

      <div class='list-caption'>What lies beneath‚Å£
 ‚Å£
In this image, Venus may look like a serene planet, with white and tan clouds reminding us of a cozy cup of coffee. In reality, Venus is a world of intense heat, crushing atmospheric pressure, and clouds of corrosive acid.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
The clouds seen here are comprised of sulfuric acid particles, as opposed to water droplets or ice crystals like on Earth. On top of being made of corrosive acid, these Venusian clouds whip around the planet at nearly over 200 mph (322 kph), circling the planet in about four and a half days.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
So far, we‚Äôve got acidic clouds and hurricane-force winds. Underneath the clouds lies extreme heat and pressure: Venus is hotter even than the innermost planet, Mercury. Venus‚Äô thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, giving it surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead! Finally, the surface pressure on Venus is 92 times that of Earth‚Äôs. To experience that pressure on our home planet, you‚Äôd have to dive more than 3,000 feet (915 m) into the ocean.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
So why do we study this seeming hellscape of a planet? Although it‚Äôs not currently habitable, Venus lies within the Sun‚Äôs "Goldilocks zone," and may have been habitable before Earth. We want to understand how Venus became an inferno-like world when it has so many other characteristics similar to ours. Future missions like DAVINCI, VERITAS, and EnVision will seek to answer this question.‚Å£
 ‚Å£

      <div class='list-caption'>Birds of a feather, we should stick together A binary pair of actively forming stars is responsible for this shimmering hourglass of gas and dust. Here, @NASAWebb‚Äôs ability to see near-infrared light reveals incredible detail and structure in Lynds 483 (L483).The two protostars lie in the center of the hourglass shape, ejecting gas and dust. When more recent cosmic material clashes with old, the varying densities cause the shimmering twists and twirls you see in this image. There are black ‚Äúvoids‚Äù where stars don‚Äôt shine through (particularly to the left of the bottom part of the hourglass)‚Äîthis is where dust is so thick that little starlight penetrates. Even Webb, which is designed to see through dust and gas, only perceives the background stars as dim pinpoints of light. Above and below the flattened disk at the center, the dust is thinner and the bright light from the stars shines through, forming the large semi-transparent orange cones that glow around the outline of the hourglass.Millions of years from now, when the stars have finished forming, and have swept the area clean, they may each be about the mass of our Sun. All that may remain is a tiny disk of gas and dust where planets may eventually form.Read more at the link in @nasawebb‚Äôs bio. Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI#Space #Stars #NASA #ESA #JWST #Astronomy #SXSW</div>

 ‚Å£
@NASAHubble recently released this colorful image of part of the Veil Nebula, which highlights emissions from hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen atoms by combining images taken in three different filters by Hubble‚Äôs Wide Field Camera 3.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
The Veil Nebula is a pretty popular subject for study: Hubble took images of this photogenic nebula in 1994, 1997, and 2015. Each image of the Veil Nebula only captures a single moment in time, but returning to photograph it again and again lets us study and understand how the supernova remnant evolves over decades. Combining this snapshot with Hubble observations from 1994 will reveal the motion of individual knots and filaments of gas over that span of time, enhancing our understanding of this stunning nebula.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: A colorful, glowing nebula in shades of blue, red, and yellow reaches beyond the top and bottom of the image. This translucent cloud of gas holds wispy and thin filaments, hard-edged in some places and puffy and opaque in others. Scattered across the colorful nebula are bright and point-like stars in the foreground and background. The rest of the background is black.‚Å£

Astronaut Don Pettit took this photo from space on Jan. 27, as the Sun began to rise over a cloudy Pacific Ocean. This long-exposure image shows off the wide band of the Milky Way, our home galaxy, above the aurora and airglow that shine closer to Earth's horizon.

@Astro_Pettit has taken countless incredible photos since arriving at the @ISS on Sept. 11, 2024‚Äîbut he's also conducting dozens of science experiments to help us learn how to live in space while making life better back on Earth. Visit blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation for the latest updates from the orbiting laboratory!

In this video, you see the moment that @FireflyAerospace‚Äôs Blue Ghost Mission 1 touched down on the surface of the Moon on March 2. These shots are from different cameras and angles on the lander. Blue Ghost traveled more than 2.8 million miles (4.5 million km) from where it launched at @NASAKennedy to the lunar surface ‚Äî and carried with it 10 NASA science and technology instruments.

These instruments are gathering data to prepare for a long-term human presence on the Moon by testing things like lunar dust mitigation, radiation tolerant computing, and lunar drilling technology. All NASA instruments onboard continue to be healthy and have already collected data.

The Blue Ghost mission is a part of NASA‚Äôs commercial lunar delivery initiative to send science and technology to the Moon.

      <div class='list-caption'>A firestorm of stars üî•

This @NASAHubble image takes a close-up look at Centaurus A, one of the brightest galaxies in Earth's night sky. At some point in the past, Centaurus A collided with another galaxy; the resulting shockwaves caused clouds of hydrogen gas to compress, setting off a firestorm of newly-forming stars. These stellar hot spots can be seen in red here, peeking out through the galaxy's dust.

Hubble took this image in 2010 with its Wide Field Camera 3. Installed on the orbiting telescope in 2009, WFC3 can study the universe in wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared‚Äîand all the visible light in between.

Image description: Bright stars light up a cloud of cosmic dust from behind; the delicate whorls of dust stretch from the top-left to the bottom-right of this image. Reddish patches of newly-forming stars are scattered throughout the cloud, with white and blue stars filling the rest of the image.

Carrying a suite of NASA science and technology, @fireflyaerospace's Blue Ghost Mission 1 successfully landed on the surface of the Moon at 3:34 a.m. EST (0834 UTC) in Mare Crisium, a more than 300-mile-wide (482-km-wide) basin in the northeast quadrant of the Moon‚Äôs near side.‚Å£
‚Å£
The Blue Ghost lander is upright, stable, and returned this image shortly after landing. This successful Moon delivery is part of NASA‚Äôs CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) initiative and #Artemis campaign. This is the first CLPS delivery for Firefly, and their first Moon landing.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
The 10 NASA science and technology instruments aboard the lander will operate on the lunar surface for approximately one lunar day, or about 14 Earth days. During this time, we hope to see images and video of a lunar eclipse from the Moon's point of view, and the lunar sunset.‚Å£

      <div class='list-caption'>Look out (and look up) this month for a total lunar eclipse!

Most skywatchers in the Western Hemisphere will be able to see the eclipse early in the morning of March 14‚Äîor late at night on March 13, depending on your time zone. The Moon will slowly pass into the Earth's shadow, looking like a bite is being taken out of its lunar disk. Then, when totality begins (at 2:26 a.m. EDT, or 0626 UTC), it will turn a deep, coppery red.

That's not the only skywatching highlight coming up, though. Mercury will make a rare appearance in the Northern Hemisphere's night skies from March 7-9, and a new moon will provide great opportunities to see faint stars and the Milky Way. Get the scoop in our latest episode of "What's Up?"!

The waters of the Patagonian Shelf have it all for the phytoplankton that bloom off Argentina, and we‚Äôll let you in on the secret formula: Airborne dust from the land, currents rich in iron, and upwelling from the ocean‚Äôs depths. This trio provides abundant nutrients for the tiny aquatic organisms that paint the ocean in shades of green and blue. 

Phytoplankton bloom during the spring and summer in the South Atlantic Ocean, thriving on the long days of sunshine. The various colors represent a mix in communities as they change throughout the months-long bloom based on nutrient availability and environmental factors. 

The exact types of phytoplankton present during a bloom can be a challenge to identify with remote sensing imagery. But, thanks to our Terra satellite, researchers were able to acquire this image to get a look at how they‚Äôre blooming. 

Image description: This image is mostly in shades of blue. The dark blue waters of the Argentine Sea set the background, while swirls of lighter blue and turquoise, along with green, move throughout the water. On the left of the image, a group of islands‚Äîthe Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)‚Äîstand out in shades of tan.

On Feb. 26 at 7:16 p.m. EST (0016 UTC), @IntuitiveMachines' Athena lunar lander lifted off from @NASAKennedy aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Athena is scheduled to touch down on Thursday, March 6, on Mons Mouton, a plateau in the Moon's South Pole region‚Äîwatch the stream on plus.nasa.gov.
 
Athena is carrying several science and technology demonstrations to gather data about Earth‚Äôs nearest neighbor and help pave the way for @NASAArtemis astronauts to explore the Moon and beyond, for the benefit of all.
 
Our Lunar Trailblazer spacecraft launched as a rideshare with the IM-2 mission and is beginning its journey to lunar orbit, tasked to map the distribution of different forms of water on the Moon. Observations gathered from its two-year mission will help us learn about water cycles on airless bodies throughout the solar system‚Äîwhile also supporting future human and robotic missions to the Moon by identifying where water is located.
 
Image descriptions: Leaving a golden streak in the sky, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the evening. The light from the rocket flames illuminates the misty night sky. NASA Kennedy's Vehicle Assembly Building, a massive rectangular building, is visible at left.

‚Å£‚Å£
Our X-59 quiet supersonic aircraft recently successfully completed a series of engine performance tests while at Lockheed Martin Skunk Works in Palmdale, California. During maximum afterburner testing ‚Äì a test that demonstrates the engine‚Äôs ability to create the thrust needed for supersonic flight ‚Äì a photographer caught a cool visual phenomenon in the X-59‚Äôs exhaust called Mach diamonds. Also known as shock diamonds, Mach diamonds occur when the pressure of the gases exiting the nozzle is less than the ambient air pressure.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
One of the major problems with commercial supersonic flight is the loudness of a sonic boom. The X-59 is the centerpiece of @NASAaero‚Äôs Quesst mission, which seeks to reduce that boom to a gentle ‚Äúthump.‚Äù Designing and building the X-59 was one of the Quesst mission‚Äôs goals; the other is to fly the X-59 over several U.S. communities, gather data on public responses to the sound, and deliver that data to national and international regulators.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£

Pulsar wind nebulas like this one are clouds of energetic X-ray-producing particles that are driven away from dead, collapsed stars. In this image, X-rays from our @NASAChandraXray observatory show up in gold and blue, while infrared rays spotted by the Victor M. Blanco 4-meter telescope are red and blue.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Astronomers estimate that light from the supernova explosion reached Earth about 1,700 years ago, or when the Mayan empire was flourishing and the Jin dynasty ruled China. However, by cosmic standards, this is one of the youngest supernova remnants in the Milky Way galaxy.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: In this composite image, a pulsar, a pulsar wind nebula, and a low energy X-ray cloud combine to create an uncanny scene of a skeletal hand preparing to grab a glowing ember. The hand reaches up from the bottom of the image; X-rays observed by Chandra are seen as the ghostly blue flesh, with the white bones represented by pulsar wind. A bright white spot in the wrist is the pulsar itself. Just beyond the hand‚Äôs fingertips, near our upper right, is a mottled yellow and orange shape that appears to glow from within. This is the low-energy X-ray cloud observed by Chandra.‚Å£

This close-up image of the Crab Nebula, originally released by @NASAHubble in 2016, reveals the beating heart of one of the most deeply-studied remnants of a supernova‚Äîin other words, the aftermath of an exploded star.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
The neutron star at the middle of the nebula (the rightmost of the two bright stars) is spinning 30 times a second, sending out pulses of radiation with clockwork regularity. The Crab Nebula, which first appeared in our skies about 1,000 years ago, is located about 6,500 light-years from Earth.‚Å£

When astronomers first studied the globular star cluster seen here in an image from @NASAHubble, they found that it appeared to be around 30% younger than other similar clusters in the Milky Way. If this cluster ‚Äì Palomar 12 ‚Äì was born in our galaxy, then it would be around the same age as other Milky Way globulars‚Ä¶ so it couldn‚Äôt be from here.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Further study revealed that Palomar 12 was actually ripped from its initial home, the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical galaxy, around 1.7 billion years ago by tidal interactions between its former home and our galaxy. The dwarf galaxy that Palomar 12 once called home is a satellite galaxy to ours, and closely orbits around us ‚Äî even occasionally passing through the plane of our galaxy.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Globular clusters like Palomar 12 can contain anywhere from tens of thousands to millions of stars, packed tightly together in dense clumps ranging from 50 to 450 light-years across. Because they contain so many stars, globular clusters are often the easiest clusters to spot in the night sky; skywatchers can see many of them with the unaided eye.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£

      <div class='list-caption'>‚ÄúLook again at that dot. That‚Äôs here. That‚Äôs home. That‚Äôs us.‚Äù ‚Äî Carl Sagan, "Pale Blue Dot," 1994‚Å£‚Å£
 ‚Å£‚Å£
Our Voyager 1 spacecraft took this iconic image of Earth 35 years ago. Voyager 1 was so far away ‚Äî 3.7 billion miles (6 billion km) ‚Äî from the Sun that, from its vantage point, Earth was just a point of light about a pixel in size. Truly a ‚ÄúPale Blue Dot.‚Äù‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Mission managers commanded the spacecraft to look back toward home for a final time. It snapped a series of 60 images that were used to create the first ‚Äúfamily portrait‚Äù of our solar system.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Carl Sagan was a prominent planetary scientist who was a consultant and adviser to NASA beginning in the 1950s. He also was a member of the Voyager Imaging Team. He had the original idea in 1981 to use the cameras on one of the two Voyager spacecraft to image Earth. He realized that because the spacecraft were so far away the images might not show much. This was precisely why Sagan and other members of the Voyager team felt the images were needed ‚Äî they wanted humanity to see Earth‚Äôs vulnerability and that our home world is just a tiny, fragile speck in the cosmic ocean.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
After snapping the Pale Blue Dot and other ‚Äúfamily photos,‚Äù Voyager 1 powered off its cameras forever to save its energy for the long journey ahead. In August 2012, Voyager 1 entered interstellar space. It‚Äôs now the most distant human-made object ever.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Image description: Earth is a single, bright blue pixel in the vastness of space. Rays of sunlight scattered within the camera optics stretch across the scene, one of which happens to have intersected dramatically with Earth. The original image was taken on Feb. 14, 1990. What you see here is an updated version from 2020 using modern image-processing software and techniques.‚Å£‚Å£

 ‚Å£
After a successful maneuver on Feb. 8, @FireflyAerospace‚Äôs Blue Ghost Mission 1 has departed Earth‚Äôs orbit and begun its four-day journey to the Moon‚Äôs orbit. Blue Ghost will spend about 16 days in lunar orbit before descending to the surface of the Moon on Mar. 2.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Blue Ghost successfully launched from @NASAKennedy on Jan. 15. Since launching more than four weeks ago, the lunar lander has performed dozens of health tests generating 15 gigabytes of data. All 10 NASA science and technology payloads onboard are healthy.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Blue Ghost is a part of our lunar delivery initiative to send NASA science and technology to the Moon ahead of crewed Artemis missions.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: Firefly‚Äôs Blue Ghost lander recently captured this image of Earth. An image of Earth is also reflected off the solar panel on the lander. The Moon can be seen on the horizon above Earth. Firefly‚Äôs X-band antenna and NASA‚Äôs Lunar Environment Heliospheric X-ray Imager (LEXI) payload are visible on the top deck of the lander. The background is filled with the darkness of space.‚Å£

A bouquet blooming with thousands of stars is captured in this image of the star-forming region 30 Doradus. This composite image combines X-ray data from our @NASAChandraXray observatory (in blue and green) with optical data from @NASAHubble (in yellow) and radio data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (in red).
 
Since 1999, our Chandra X-ray Observatory has been studying the universe from low Earth orbit. Chandra, the world's most powerful X-ray telescope, has given astronomers new insights into black holes, distant galaxies, and stellar explosions.
 
Image description: A composite image of a star-forming region of space known as 30 Doradus, which is shaped like a bouquet or a maple leaf. X-ray wind and gas takes the shape of a massive purple and pink bouquet with an extended central flower. The hazy, mottled shape occupies much of the image, positioned just to the left of center. Inside the purple and pink gas and wind cloud are red and orange veins and pockets of bright white light. The hazy purple and pink bouquet is surrounded by glowing dots of green, white, orange, and red. A second mottled purple cloud, which resembles a ring of smoke, floats in the lower-right corner.

      <div class='list-caption'>Look up, let your hair down ‚Äì howl if you like ‚Äì for it‚Äôll be a full moon!‚Å£
 ‚Å£
After cozying up to Venus, Jupiter, and Mars earlier this month, the Moon reaches peak illumination on Feb. 12.‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Looking at the Moon with only your eyes, you‚Äôll see mostly areas of white and gray. The gray patches are solidified volcanic lava flows. When the Moon was young, its interior was still molten, and magma would erupt onto its surface. The lighter-colored areas are called the highlands, and show the earliest crust on the Moon, dominated by a type of rock called anorthosite.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
What you see on the Moon with just your eyes will vary depending on your eyesight. Give yourself plenty of time for your eyes to adjust and look carefully. Looking with binoculars or a telescope will reveal more details, like mountain ridges and crater chains.‚Å£‚Å£
 ‚Å£
For better viewing of craters and mountains, try phases other than the full moon. The shadows on the surface will be more pronounced, and help distinguish features you might otherwise miss.‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Image description: In this picture from May 25, 2021, the nearly full moon rises over National Harbor in Fort Washington, Maryland. The Moon is just under the tip of the triangle shape formed by a structure. Some buildings and water can be seen in the background, while a few people are in the dimly lit foreground.‚Å£‚Å£

We don‚Äôt know the rate of return on scoring a dinner invitation with this information, but what you see here is the light from a distant galaxy bending around a closer one. The @EuropeanSpaceAgency‚Äôs Euclid telescope snapped this observation of a rare phenomenon called an Einstein ring.‚Å£

The gravity of this elliptical galaxy, which is around 590 million light-years from Earth, acts as a lens. It magnifies a much more distant bright galaxy, some 4.42 billion light-years away, into a ring of light. ‚Å£

Developed by ESA with contributions from @NASA, Euclid is surveying the cosmos to help us understand the dark side of the universe. We can‚Äôt wait to see what it reveals next!‚Å£
Image descriptions:‚Å£
 ‚Å£
1. The large, hazy oval of elliptical galaxy NGC 6505 illuminates the center of this image from the European Space Agency‚Äôs Euclid mission. At the heart of the galaxy is a small bright spot surrounded by a thin white circle, which is a magnified view of a much more distant galaxy. The view is also filled with countless colorful stars and galaxies of various sizes and shapes amidst the blackness of space. Thin spikes of light extend from the brightest stars due to the observatory‚Äôs optics.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
2. A thin ring of a perfect circular shape and a piercingly bright white disc in its middle are the protagonists of this image. They ‚Å£stand out against a uniformly colored background of a hazy dark grey. The ring appears as if it was a faint brush stroke, where at four evenly spaced spots more pressure was applied on the brush. These stand out in the ring as four brighter and thicker spots. The white disc within the ring gives the impression of a gaping hole in the image, through its stark contrast to the dark background.‚Å£

Orbiting Earth 16 times a day, the International Space Station is about 250 miles (400 km) closer to the stars than the rest of us back on Earth. From the @ISS, our @NASAAstronauts get a unique perspective on landmarks and cities around the globe‚Äîincluding New Orleans, the site of this year's #SuperBowl.
 
Astronaut @astro_pettit captured this image of New Orleans on Oct. 26, 2024; Pettit has taken countless pictures from low Earth orbit as part of his "Science of Opportunity" since lifting off to the station last September. Visit nasa.gov/iss to learn more about what we're discovering aboard the orbiting laboratory!
 
Image description: An image of New Orleans as seen from the International Space Station at night. The city's lights stand out in bright white, with key streets and blocks standing out. The Mississippi River can be seen snaking through the city center, with Lake Pontchartrain marking an end to the city's lights on their northern border.

‚Å£
Our @NASAChandraXray observatory captured this colorful scene of two spiral galaxies merging. This galaxy pair is located about 250 million light-years away and can be found in the constellation of Serpens. ‚Å£
‚Å£
The collision of the two spiral galaxies happened about 700 million years ago, sparking an enormous burst of star formation. About 200 huge star clusters reside in a packed, dusty region about 5,000 light-years across‚Äîabout 5% of the Milky Way‚Äôs diameter. The amount of gas in this tiny region is equal to all of the gas in the entire Milky Way. ‚Å£
‚Å£
Image description: This composite image features an ultra-luminous infrared galaxy, surrounded by a soft, rose-pink cloud of X-ray gas. Here, a single, bright, golden white dot sits at the center of the image. The rose-pink cloud surrounding the dot appears soft and airy, like cotton candy. Upon close inspection, feint orange veins can be discerned, marbling the X-ray gas cloud seen with Chandra. Surrounding the gas cloud are other distant galaxies and stars, set against the blackness of space. Most are orange or white, and range from tiny specks to small glowing ovals.‚Å£

These looping funnel clouds are half a light-year in length‚Äîbut don't worry, they're not touching down near Earth anytime soon. They're swirling 5,000 light-years away in the Lagoon Nebula, which can be found in the constellation Sagittarius.

Our @NASAHubble telescope spotted these twisters nearly 30 years ago, based on observations collected from July to September of 1995. Like tornadoes back on Earth, the sharp differences in temperature between the hot surface of the nebula's clouds and their cold interior (combined with the pressure of sunlight) may twist these tornadoes into the shapes you see here.

Image description: A nebula, lit in soft shades of blue, green and yellow, is intersected by a pair of much darker funnel clouds, which reach from the top-left to the bottom-right of the image. A red, slightly pixellated star shines through the cloud in the bottom right.

‚Å£
NASA astronaut Suni Williams took this selfie on Jan. 30, 2025, as the @ISS orbited 263 miles (423 km) above the Pacific Ocean. This irresistible photo op happened during Williams' ninth spacewalk; she and fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore removed hardware from the outside of the station and collected samples of surface material from sites near life support system vents ‚Äî the Destiny laboratory and the Quest airlock ‚Äî for analysis. ‚Å£
Studying these samples will tell us whether the space station releases microorganisms, how many, and how far they may travel. In addition, we could learn whether these microorganisms survive and reproduce in the harsh space environment and how they may perform in places like the Moon and Mars.‚Å£
‚Å£
Williams made history during last week's spacewalk: she surpassed former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson‚Äôs record for total spacewalking time by a female astronaut. Williams now has 62 hours, 6 minutes of total spacewalk time, fourth on NASA‚Äôs all-time list.‚Å£
‚Å£
Image description: Astronaut Suni Williams‚Äô arms and hands, and the camera she‚Äôs holding, are reflected in the shiny visor of her spacesuit‚Äôs helmet. You can also see part of the International Space Station and the darkness of space, as well as the Pacific Ocean on our left. Looking around Williams‚Äô helmet, we can see other parts of her spacesuit, and a little bit of space on the right.‚Å£

 ‚Å£
A massive galaxy nicknamed Bullseye ripples with nine star-filled rings as a blue dwarf galaxy plunges through the center like a dart. The smaller galaxy, visible just to the left of center in this image, shot through the middle of Bullseye about 50 million years ago, leaving rings like ripples in a pond. Galaxies collide or barely miss one another quite frequently (cosmically speaking) but it‚Äôs rare for one galaxy to dive through the center of another.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
High-resolution imagery from @NASAHubble, which captured this image, confirmed eight of Bullseye‚Äôs rings, with data from the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii finding a ninth. Astronomers will now be able to better study how the galaxy‚Äîand its rings‚Äîmay continue to evolve over billions of years.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: A large galaxy is at center, and a significantly smaller galaxy is to its left. It has several rings. Its circular core is bright white at the very center, but light yellow overall. Going outward, there are gaps between the rings. At 9 o‚Äôclock is a small dwarf galaxy. It is about the same size as the yellow core of the Bullseye. The dwarf galaxy is blue, with many dots. It looks like the edge of the Bullseye might touch the dwarf galaxy. Both galaxies are set on the black background of space, which is dotted with a range of galaxies in different shapes, colors, and sizes, along with one foreground star at left.‚Å£

      <div class='list-caption'>Stars hatched by a swan üåü

Our WISE telescope captured this image, released in June 2011, of a huge complex of star-forming clouds and stellar clusters in the constellation Cygnus. Star clusters are groups of stars that share an origin, forming at roughly the same time and location, and are tied together by gravity for up to millions or even billions of years.

Different types of stars have different life spans, so clusters will change over time as stars evolve. Some clusters might contain big, hot, O-type stars. Others might hold smaller, cooler stars that age and change over billions of years. Star clusters can contain anywhere from as few as a dozen stars to upwards of millions, and those stars can be spread out over a few light-years to hundreds of light-years.

WISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) was an infrared-wavelength astronomical space telescope. It was placed into hibernation in February 2011, having completed its primary astrophysics mission. Then, in 2013, the spacecraft was assigned a new mission as NEOWISE (Near-Earth Object Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer), to help find near-Earth asteroids and comets. Its mission ended on July 31, 2024.

Image description: This image is dominated by curving green clouds, except at top left and middle, where there are also red clouds. A few bright yellow stars shine through the most defined clouds. There are also tiny multicolored ‚Äì though mostly blue ‚Äì dots of light throughout the whole area.

      <div class='list-caption'>Black Holes: Cooked. Ate. Left no crumbs.
 
Recent studies show that black holes in the universe can create their own meals. Data from our @nasachandraxray Observatory and the Very Large Telescope (VLT) provide new evidence that outbursts from black holes can help cool down gas to feed themselves.
 
The centers of galaxy clusters contain the universe‚Äôs most massive galaxies, which harbor huge black holes with masses ranging from millions to tens of billions of times that of the Sun. Jets from these black holes are driven by the black holes feasting on gas.
 
The latest research supports a model where outbursts from the black holes trigger hot gas to cool and form narrow filaments of warm gas. Some of the warm gas in these filaments should then flow into the centers of the galaxies to feed the black holes, causing an outburst. The outburst causes more gas to cool and feed the black holes, leading to further outbursts - a cosmic buffet!
 
Image descriptions: A swipe-through of different galaxy clusters, each with a central black hole surrounded by patches and filaments of gas. In each image, a patch of purple with neon pink veins floats in the blackness of space, surrounded by flecks of light. At the center of each patch is a glowing, bright white dot. The bright white dots represent black holes. The purple patches represent hot X-ray gas, and the neon pink veins represent filaments of warm gas.
 
In the image of the Perseus Cluster on the left, the surrounding flecks of light are larger and brighter, making the individual galaxies they represent easier to discern. The purple gas has a blue tint, and the hot pink filaments appear solid, as if rendered with quivering strokes of a paintbrush. The Centaurus Cluster is on the right; in this image, the purple gas appears softer, with a more diffuse quality. The filaments are rendered in more detail, with feathery edges, and range in color from pale pink to neon red.

Voyager 2 captured this image of Saturn and two of its moons, Rhea and Dione, on July 21, 1981. In this picture, Rhea is below and to the left of Saturn, while Dione is directly below the massive planet.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Rhea looks itty-bitty in this picture, yet it‚Äôs Saturn‚Äôs second-largest moon! Rhea is small, cold, and airless - very similar to sister moons Dione, pictured here, and Tethys. How cold is Rhea? It‚Äôs as ‚Äúwarm‚Äù as -281¬∫F (-174¬∫C) in sunlit areas, ranging down to -364¬∫F (-220¬∫C) in the shade.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Rhea appeared as a tiny dot to astronomers until the Voyager (1 and 2) encounters in 1980 and 1981. The Voyager images showed that Rhea‚Äôs features could be divided into two regions: heavily cratered terrain with craters larger than 25 miles (40 kilometers) across and a second type of area in parts of the polar and equatorial region with craters less than 25 miles (40 kilometers) across. This difference may indicate there was a major resurfacing event some time in Rhea‚Äôs history.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Dione is Saturn‚Äôs fourth-largest moon. It also has terrain with varying amounts of craters, along with fractured areas that often cut through its plains and craters. These fractures suggest Dione experienced tectonic activity in its past. The fractured areas are seen in Voyager images as bright and thin wispy lines. Later, flybys by our Cassini spacecraft showed these ‚Äúwisps‚Äù as bright canyon ice walls.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Rhea and Dione were both discovered by Giovanni Cassini, and both get their names from Greek mythology.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: Saturn is tilted to the side in this image. It is yellowish, with a brighter, buttery yellow at its middle, where the planet‚Äôs rings surround it. Below Saturn are two small dots: These are two of its moons, Rhea and Dione. They all stand out against the darkness of space.‚Å£

Dust gets a bad rap, doesn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs a nuisance in houses, but out in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), it adds to the beauty of the scene. @NASAHubble captured this image of part of the LMC ‚Äì the outskirts of the Tarantula Nebula ‚Äì marked by gas, patches of dust, and many-colored stars.
 
The stars here get their different colors thanks to that dust: Dust absorbs and scatters blue light more than red light, allowing more of the red light to reach our telescopes, which makes the stars appear redder than they are.
 
Using Hubble observations of dusty nebulae in the Large Magellanic Cloud and other galaxies, researchers can study these dust grains, helping them better understand the role that cosmic dust plays in the formation of new stars and planets.
 
Image description: Multicolored stars are sprinkled mostly on the left side of the image, shining through clouds of gas and dust. Gas appears blue here, laced with brownish-orange patches of dust.

Our Curiosity rover took this 360-degree panorama of the Red Planet in 2021. It was standing atop "Mont Mercou," a rock formation looking over Gale Crater, the region of Mars where Curiosity first landed in 2012.

Since then, Curiosity has been exploring the Martian landscape, studying the planet's geography and geology. Along with our Perseverance rover, which touched down in Jezero Crater in 2021, Curiosity is helping us understand the ancient past of Mars, when it could have been home to microbial life.

Image description: A several-slide panorama of Mars, as seen from the Curiosity rover's Mastcam. A reddish cliff juts out over a dark-colored valley below it; on the right side of the image, a large hill rises in the distance. Various bits of Curiosity's hardware peek out from the edges of the image. This panorama was stitched together from many individual images; black edges mark areas not imaged, as terrain imagery was prioritized over hardware imagery for resource management. The panorama has been white-balanced so that the colors of the rock materials resemble how they would appear under daytime lighting conditions on Earth.

This 100-million-year-old star cluster is brought to us with data from not one, but a trio of telescopes. Visible in the constellation Dorado and located within the Large Magellanic Cloud ‚Äì this smaller neighbor galaxy to the Milky Way ‚Äì NGC 1850 is about 63,000 times the mass of our Sun, and its core is roughly 20 light-years in diameter.

Data from each of the three telescopes can be identified by their colors. X-rays from @ChandraXray are magenta, while optical wavelengths from @NASAHubble are in red, yellow, green, cyan, and blue. Infrared energy from the Spitzer Space Telescope is also in red.

Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, is known to have X-ray-producing auroras around its poles, but those aren‚Äôt the only rays in the neighborhood. In this image of Jupiter, the purple space lumps surrounding the planet are massive clouds of X-rays observed by our @NASAChandraXray telescope‚Äîsome are even larger than the planet itself.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Jupiter‚Äôs auroras can also be seen as thin purple bands, particularly near the planet‚Äôs north pole. In this particular image, Jupiter is shown in infrared frequencies captured by @NASAHubble.‚Å£

Image description: In this composite image, Jupiter is set against the blackness of space, flanked by neon purple blobs. Jupiter is presented in exceptionally clear focus. More than a dozen bands of swirling gas streak the surface, each a different texture and shade of grey. The gas giant is encircled by a fine, sky-blue ring, the same color as the large storm which swirls on its surface at the lower right. Large hazy blobs of neon purple flank Jupiter.‚Å£

Released in 2019, this is the first image of a black hole and its shadow, which represents a historic feat by an international network of radio telescopes called the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). A black hole is an extremely dense object from which no light can escape. Anything that comes within a black hole‚Äôs ‚Äúevent horizon,‚Äù its point of no return, will be consumed, never to re-emerge, because of the black hole‚Äôs unimaginably strong gravity. Not unlike the Black Lodge.

In this image, you can see the shadow of the supermassive black hole in the center of Messier 87 (M87), an elliptical galaxy some 55 million light-years from Earth. This black hole is 6.5 billion times the mass of the Sun. Catching its shadow involved eight ground-based radio telescopes around the globe, operating together as if they were one telescope the size of our entire planet.

In memory of David Lynch, we will continue to explore the otherworldly and the unknown. We will focus not on the loss, but on what we gained from the years we shared this planet with you. We will see you in our dreams.

Image description: Using the Event Horizon Telescope, scientists obtained this image of the black hole at the center of galaxy M87, outlined by emission from hot gas swirling around it under the influence of strong gravity near its event horizon. The hot gas is shaped like a doughnut and is glowing a warm yellow color with reddish tint at its edges. The darkness of space is black in the background.

This sandhill crane is one of the 1,500 different species of plants and animals that make their home at @NASAKennedy, which shares space with the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge. The Space Coast is a particularly favorable environment for sandhill cranes due to the region's shallow freshwater habitats, which provide nesting space and a variety of food sources. 

Behind the crane, in the background, you can see the Vehicle Assembly Building, one of the largest buildings in the world and the staging ground for NASA‚Äôs biggest rockets‚Äîincluding the @NASAArtemis I rocket which launched our Orion spacecraft around the Moon in 2022. 

Image description: The large, brown eyes of a sandhill crane stare directly into the camera; the crane‚Äôs head, its long, grey, narrow neck, and the top of its body are visible. A blue sky with scattered clouds takes up most of the background; the square outline of the Vehicle Assembly Building, including its large, painted NASA ‚Äúmeatball‚Äù insignia, can be seen out of focus at the very bottom of the image.

 ‚Å£
The James Webb Space Telescope is giving astronomers an unprecedented look at the fine details and 3D structure of the dust and gas between the stars.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
The space between the stars is not empty, but rather filled with filaments of dust and gas (known as the interstellar medium), which is often invisible until something illuminates it.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Here, a long-ago supernova explosion, acting like a flashbulb, has heated some of this interstellar material, causing it to glow in the infrared, creating a thermal ‚Äúlight echo.‚Äù‚Å£
 ‚Å£
As the supernova illumination travels through space at the speed of light, the echo appears to expand. Click the link in @NASAWebb‚Äôs bio to read more and to see more images and a video showing the change over time.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
The structures in these filaments are on a remarkably small scale of about 400 astronomical units, or less than one-hundredth of a light-year. (An astronomical unit, or AU, is the average Earth-Sun distance and is equal to 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers.)‚Å£

Image descriptions: Two frames show an infrared light echo traveling from the lower left of the first image through the upper right of the second image. They are not perfectly contiguous due to how the data were collected. Each image is speckled with dozens of white stars, some showing Webb‚Äôs signature 8-point diffraction spikes, against the black background of space. The images also show tightly packed, glowing red filaments that resemble muscle fibers or wood grain.‚Å£

It helps to think we‚Äôre sleeping underneath the same big sky üåï‚Å£
 ‚Å£
The first full moon of 2025 is here. Tonight, Jan. 13, look up as the full moon cozies up to Mars; for skywatchers across the U.S. and Eastern Canada, the Moon will appear to pass in front of the Red Planet for a few hours as the pair rise into the eastern sky.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Mars also will be the lone planet in the sky on January mornings. You‚Äôll find it hanging out in the west in morning twilight. The Moon will appear full through Wednesday morning.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: In this photo, taken in 2021, the nearly-full moon rises over a flock of birds flying and a row of buildings in Washington. The scene was captured during twilight, giving the image a blue hue; the Moon stands out in an orange shade. Streetlights can be seen peeking out from the shadows of trees.‚Å£

      <div class='list-caption'>Multiple fires have been burning in Los Angeles County since early January. Smoke plumes from the fires can be seen over the Pacific Ocean from space, visible in this @NOAA-20 satellite image from Jan. 9. Powerful Santa Ana winds and a lack of rain created ‚Äúcritical‚Äù fire weather conditions in Southern California, according to the @nws, contributing to the rapid spread of the fires.
 
As of Jan. 10, the Palisades Fire in California has burned nearly 20,000 acres. This fire, along with many others in the area, have forced evacuations in and around the Los Angeles area, including our @NASAJPL facility. Historically, California‚Äôs fire season runs from June or July through October or early November. The hot, dry conditions that drive fire season are now present longer into the winter, fueled by a warmer climate. NASA just confirmed 2024 was the hottest year on record.
 
We continue to think of all our colleagues, friends, and first responders affected by the fires during this time.

Out of the dozens of moons that orbit Saturn, the one that‚Äôs closest to the gas giant is Mimas, first discovered in 1789 by English astronomer William Herschel. Mimas is about 115,000 miles (186,000 km) from Saturn‚Äîhalf the distance from the Earth to the Moon‚Äîand takes just 22.5 hours to make a lap around the giant planet. 

Mimas can be seen at the very bottom of this image, which was taken by our Cassini spacecraft in 2005. Behind it, Saturn‚Äôs northern latitudes shine in a cool blue, with shadows from its rings forming long, dark lines on the atmosphere. 

Image description: The surface of Saturn takes up most of this image, with thin, dark lines arcing down and to the right over a periwinkle-colored atmosphere. At the very bottom, just left of center, the moon Mimas appears as a gray, slightly dimpled circle.

      <div class='list-caption'>That‚Äôs no Moon‚Ä¶‚Å£
‚Å£
Because it‚Äôs Mercury! No one would blame you for mistaking one for the other, though. The two bodies do have some visual similarities: Mercury is only slightly larger than our Moon, and they‚Äôre both gray and cratered. NASA‚Äôs MESSENGER spacecraft captured this visible and infrared light view of the planet on Jan. 14, 2008, about 80 minutes before it made its closest pass at a distance of about 17,000 miles (27,000 kilometers). MESSENGER would go on to conduct two more flybys of Mercury on Oct. 6, 2008, and Sept. 29, 2009.‚Å£
‚Å£
MESSENGER ‚Äì which stands for Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging ‚Äì was the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury. Its primary goal was to study the geology, magnetic field, and chemical composition of the planet. It was the first mission to Mercury after Mariner 10, more than 30 years before.‚Å£
‚Å£
One of the first things MESSENGER discovered was high concentrations of magnesium and calcium on Mercury‚Äôs night side. It also found large amounts of water in the outermost layer of Mercury‚Äôs atmosphere and revealed evidence of past volcanic activity on the surface.‚Å£
‚Å£
The spacecraft completed its primary mission on March 17, 2012, having taken nearly 100,000 images of the surface of Mercury.‚Å£
‚Å£
Image description: Mercury looks almost like a waning crescent moon in this image. About three-quarters of the planet are in the frame, with only a thin slice of it lit. The bright part stands out starkly against the darkness of space.‚Å£

All month in January, look up at the night sky to see Venus, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter. Mid-month, Venus and Saturn will pass near each other, cozying up on Jan. 17 and 18 before parting ways.
 
Next door, our planetary neighbor, Mars, will reach opposition this month, which happens when the planet lies directly on the opposite side of Earth from the Sun, forming a straight line.
 
On Jan. 3, the Quadrantid meteor shower will peak and be visible through Jan. 12. For those in the Northern Hemisphere, your best viewing options will occur after midnight with clear, dark skies.
 
Happy skywatching!

Image description: A stunning, vibrant image of Earth as seen from space. This image focuses on North America, with its green fields and yellow-brown deserts partially covered beneath swirling white clouds. The bright blue of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans takes up most of this image, with the Arctic ice pack and South America just visible at the very top and bottom, respectively. This image, the most detailed true-color image of Earth to date when it was originally released in 2002, is based primarily on data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, or MODIS.

      <div class='list-caption'>Shooting for the stars... üåü 

NASA astronaut Jeanette Epps used her unique vantage point aboard the @ISS to capture the perfect shot: a long-exposure photo of Earth as stars glittered above the atmosphere. 

Setting the camera‚Äôs light sensitivity (ISO) to 3200‚Äîa higher sensitivity used to capture more detailed images in low-light conditions‚ÄîEpps positioned her lens in one of the space station‚Äôs many windows and clicked the shutter. What resulted 68 seconds later was a stunning portrait showcasing streaks of city lights across Western Australia, with swirls of stars above Earth‚Äôs golden-red atmosphere. 

Photographs like this show just how quickly the space station‚Äîand astronauts aboard‚Äîmoves as it orbits our home planet: a whopping 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kph). It also gives our @NASAAstronauts novel opportunities to try out new camera techniques that may just result in a spectacular view for us to enjoy here on Earth as well. 

Image description: In the bottom half of this image, displayed over two slides, Earth glows in hues of gold as a red atmospheric glow curves above. Yellow city lights streak across Earth horizontally, as star trails create a circular pattern in motion directly above.

The new moon begins on Dec. 30, 2024, when the illuminated side of the Moon faces the Sun and the night side faces Earth. This long-duration photograph, taken with a camera programmed with high sensitivity, shows an astronaut's perspective during a new moon phase on Sept. 4, 2024, as the Moon set behind Earth's colorful, but dimming atmosphere.
 
For astronauts on the International Space Station (@ISS), the Moon appears to rise and set 16 times per day, as the station orbits Earth about every 90 minutes.
 
Image description: A new moon with a sliver of the edge illuminated appears behind the edge of Earth's atmosphere, during moonset, and soon to be hidden behind Earth. The atmosphere is blue, with orange and yellow hues below.

      <div class='list-caption'>Sometimes you‚Äôve got to bloom before you glow. üåü 

...just like this rare Wolf-Rayet star did before going supernova. 15,000 light years away from the constellation Sagittarius, WR 124 shed its outer layers, resulting in halos of gas and dust that appear like a blooming flower‚Äîa fleeting phase that happens to only some stars before they explode. 

In this composite image from @NASAChandraXray, @NASAWebb and WISE, WR 124 gleams as dozens of other bright stars surround it. X-rays from Chandra are colorized purple, while infrared frequencies captured from WISE are blue. Observations from Webb‚Äôs Near-Infrared and Mid-Infrared instruments are red, green, and blue. 

The star itself is 30 times the mass of our Sun and has shed 10 Suns‚Äô worth of material so far. As the gas moves away and cools, cosmic dust forms, showering astronomers with a deeper insight into a crucial period in the early history of our universe. Stars similar to WR 124 first seeded the young universe with heavy elements forged in their cores ‚Äì elements that are now common in the universe‚Äôs current season, including on Earth. 

Image description: A large eight-pointed star shines at the center of the image in white and blue hues. Surrounding it near the center are yellow clouds of dust, with outer portions of purple clouds of dust. Together, the star and dust resemble a blooming flower. Around it are purple specks and other blue eight-pointed stars. The black background of space the star sits against is glittered with additional stars.

 ‚Å£
A rainbow of color is visible on Saturn‚Äôs rings in this image captured by the @NASASolarSystem Cassini spacecraft‚Äôs wide-angle camera on June 12, 2007, when it was 325,000 miles (523,000 km) from Saturn. The halo of light moving across Saturn‚Äôs sunlit rings created an opposition effect, or an artifact and by-product of the spot‚Äôs movement and the way the color image was produced.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Cassini acquired color images by taking sequential exposures using red, green, and blue spectra filters which are then combined to form a color view.  The bright patch traveled across the rings between exposures taken for this view, creating a series of three colorful spots showing the bright patch‚Äôs position at three separate moments.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: The rings of Saturn intersect this image, arcing downwards from left to right, with the yellowish gas giant looming in the background. At the center of one of the bands of rings is a small spot of light that glows in rainbow colors.‚Å£

      <div class='list-caption'>Last Christmas, @nasachandraxray gave us a cluster of stars. This year, new telescope views (combined with Chandra data) gave us something special.The Christmas Tree Cluster, located in our Milky Way about 2,500 light-years away from Earth, is a cluster of young stars between 1 million and 5 million years old. These stars are seen here as blue and white lights, representing the X-rays they give off that are detected by Chandra. They‚Äôre surrounded by swirls of gas‚Äîthe ‚Äúpine needles‚Äù of the tree‚Äîwith green representing light in the visible spectrum.In the first image, optical data (in green and violet) was captured by astrophotographer Michael Clow from his telescope in Arizona in November 2024. In the second image of the cluster, released in 2023, optical data (in green) was observed by the National Science Foundation‚Äôs WIYN 0.9-meter telescope on Kitt Peak in Arizona.The images have been rotated clockwise by about 160 degrees from the astronomer‚Äôs standard of North pointing upward, so that it appears like the top of the tree is toward the top of the image.Image descriptions:1. Wispy green clouds in a conical shape strongly resemble an evergreen tree. Tiny specks of white, blue, purple, and red light, stars within the cluster, dot the structure, turning the cloud into a festive, cosmic Christmas tree.2. Wispy green lines and shapes resemble the boughs and needles of an evergreen tree, with glowing lights of blue and white - stars within the cluster - scattered across it. The peak of the tree is at the top center of the image. Stars are seen in the foreground and background as gleaming specks of white light against the blackness of space.Credits: 1.

‚Å£‚Å£
Journey through the darkness of space to the constellation Aquila for a spectacular light show. This nebula, around 7,200 light-years away from Earth, is a hotbed of high-mass star formation. The stars that are born here are so massive that they will eventually become supernovae. Still, as they form, they shape their surroundings: the protostar at the center of the image sends out a jet of material toward us.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
This picture was taken with @NASAHubble‚Äôs Wide Field Camera 3 as part of research that measured the extent of ionization in the jets coming from the protostar within this nebula. Ionization is the process by which atoms or molecules become charged, often because they are in such a high-energy environment that they have lost some of their electrons.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Image description: On the left side of the image, we can see the dark nebula, with some dust clouds faintly lit by nearby stars. Near the very center is a bright orange protostar; the jet of material it is emitting streams outward. A large number of stars are scattered throughout the entire image.‚Å£‚Å£

      <div class='list-caption'>Planets: Let them cook!‚Å£
‚Å£
A @NASAHubble study from 2003 suggested that the gigantic disks that gave rise to planets in the early universe were longer-lived than they should be, given the conditions of their environment. Old stars don‚Äôt have enough of the heavier elements that are necessary ingredients to form the planets. But how are they still able to cook at the ripe old age of 20 to 30 million years?‚Å£
‚Å£
To answer this question, researchers used @NASAWebb to study stars in a nearby galaxy that, much like the early universe, lacks large amounts of heavy elements. The circles in the second image show the positions of the 10 stars surveyed. The researchers found that not only do some stars there have planet-forming disks, but that those disks are longer-lived than those seen around young stars in our Milky Way galaxy‚Äîconfirming Hubble‚Äôs original findings.‚Å£
‚Å£
Image descriptions: ‚Å£
1. The center of the image contains arcs of orange and pink that form a boat-like shape. One end of these arcs points to the top right of the image, while the other end point toward the bottom left. Another plume of orange and pink expands from the center to the top left of the image. To the right of this plume is a large cluster of white stars. There are various other white stars and a few galaxies of different sizes spread throughout the image.‚Å£
‚Å£
2. The second image is the same as the first, but annotated with 10 small, yellow circles overlaid at various points to indicate the positions of the stars surveyed in this study.‚Å£

      <div class='list-caption'>If you tilt your head to the side and squint‚Ä¶ ü§î‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Thankfully, you don‚Äôt need to do either to see this sideways discovery. NASA researchers found that the black hole within the galaxy NGC 5084 is ‚Äútipped over!‚Äù The dark vertical line at the center of this image is a disk of dust that orbits the galaxy‚Äôs core. The disk‚Äôs presence implies that there‚Äôs a supermassive black hole there that also has a vertical orientation.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Astronomers at @NASAAmes used new techniques to study legacy data from @nasachandraxray and found four long plumes of plasma ‚Äì hot, charged gas ‚Äì emanating from NGC 5084. Hot gas plumes are not often spotted in galaxies, and typically only one or two are present. The surprising second set of plumes was a strong clue this galaxy housed a supermassive black hole, but there could have been other explanations.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
What they saw in the Chandra data seemed so strange that they immediately looked to confirm it, digging into the data archives of other telescopes and requesting new observations from two powerful ground-based observatories. They found this @NASAHubble image with the vertical dusty disk, which also suggested the presence of a black hole there, and that the black hole had a vertical orientation compared to the galaxy.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
We don‚Äôt yet know why this galaxy‚Äôs black hole has such an unusual orientation, but some possible explanations are a collision with another galaxy or the formation of a chimney of superheated gas breaking out of the top and bottom of the galactic plane.‚Å£
 ‚Å£

This star cluster resembles a cosmic wreath, with shining stars sparkling among festive clouds. We can see it here thanks to our @NASAWebb and @NASAChandraXRay telescopes, which are constantly looking out at distant galaxies from their place in space. Webb is at a stable position between the Sun and Earth, about 1 million miles away from us, while Chandra is orbiting Earth at an altitude of approximately 86,500 miles.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Neither telescope looks at the universe in visible light frequencies, so these infrared and X-ray observations have been shifted into colors we can see for this particular image. This star cluster, officially known as NGC 602, is in the Small Magellanic Cloud just beyond our Milky Way.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: This is a composite image of star cluster NGC 602, in vibrant and festive colors. The shape of the star cluster strongly resembles a holiday wreath. The cluster includes a giant dust cloud ring, shown in greens, yellows, blues, and orange; the image is also aglow with specks and dots of colorful, festive light, representing stars within the cluster.‚Å£

MISSE-20-Commercial, the latest research to join the Materials ISS Experiment Flight Facility, holds 12 experiments. One of them, called SEAQUE, is testing technologies that could help quantum communications tools "self-heal" against radiation damage they might encounter in the environment of space. You‚Äôll see Canadarm2 and Dextre move this experiment out of the Kibo laboratory module's airlock and into position as Earth rotates underneath. The sunlight shifts across the window frame, acting like a giant space sundial over the course of the timelapse.

Astronomers estimate that our universe could hold up to 2 trillion galaxies‚Äîbut the Milky Way is the only one known, so far, to support life. 

The Milky Way is about 100,000 light-years wide, with roughly 200 billion stars packed within its twin spiral arms. Our Sun, and solar system, are about halfway from the Milky Way's center‚Äîwhich is why you can see the galaxy shining in the night sky if you're far from cities and bright lights.

This image of the Milky Way was captured at the @nationalparkservice's Dinosaur National Monument, located in Colorado and Utah.

But it may still be a galaxy. This sparkling field is Abell 2125, a galaxy cluster located 3 billion light-years away from us in the Ursa Minor constellation. Each golden yellow dot you see is an individual galaxy, captured in visible light by the Kitt Peak National Observatory. The purple dots and haze are gas clouds seen in X-ray light by @NASAChandraXray. X-rays are not part of the visible light spectrum, so they've been translated into color we can see in this image.
 
It takes billions of years to build a massive galaxy cluster like Abell 2125, which may contain thousands of galaxies. Since it‚Äôs so far away, this cluster also gives us insight into the early stages of galaxy cluster development, as well as the effects on galaxies within it. For example, data from Chandra, @NASAHubble, and the Very Large Array show that several galaxies in Abell 2125 are being stripped of their gas as they fall through hot, high-pressure clouds.

Saturn's moon Mimas stands alone in this ethereal image captured by our Cassini spacecraft in 2004. Mimas is the smallest of Saturn's major moons, checking in at less than 123 miles (198 km) wide. Its most prominent feature is a massive impact crater, with a small bump in the middle that draws comparisons to the Death Star from Star Wars.

Saturn's rings stretch across the bottom of this image, with a small gap near the top known as the Cassini division. (Both this gap and the spacecraft were named after Jean-Dominique Cassini, the first astronomer to discover several of Saturn's moons.) These rings cast shadows on the cool, blue-streaked backdrop of Saturn's northern hemisphere, fading into darkness on Saturn's night side.

Image description: Two bands of color arc across this photo of space: a brownish-tan streak across the bottom of the image, and blue-white streaks arcing downward from left to right. A small moon, half in shadow, touches one of the white bands near the right side of the image.

NASA astronaut @astro_pettit used a homemade tracking device to capture this starfield from a window on the SpaceX Dragon crew spacecraft docked to the International Space Station.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
To get a stellar view like this, Pettit took a 25-second-long exposure with an ISO (camera light sensitivity) of 3200. With a longer exposure ‚Äì that is, leaving the camera‚Äôs shutter open for a longer period of time ‚Äì more light falls on the camera‚Äôs sensor. On top of that, the cameras the astronauts often use are designed to be more sensitive in low-light situations. All this means they‚Äôre more likely to capture bright stars in their images.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Images of the Earth from orbit are typically taken with exposures just right to image the bright planet, but too short to record many stars, which are far dimmer in comparison.‚Å£

The colorful supernova remnant DEM L 190 resembles a cosmic flaming marshmallow as it billows across the screen in this image captured by @NASAHubble. Located approximately 160,000 light-years away from Earth, these delicate sheets and intricate filaments are debris from the death of a massive star that once lived in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: A supernova remnant appears to float in space. Its core glows in shades of yellow and gold, as filaments wisp out into cooler shades of blue. The remnant‚Äôs shape is similar to a cone, spiraling upwards towards the top of the image. The background is dotted with stars in various shades of red and purple.‚Å£

      <div class='list-caption'>You know Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter,
Saturn, and Geminid meteors, too,
But do you recall... the longest night of them all?
(In the Northern Hemisphere, that is.)

This month has it all: planetary cameos, appearances from distant stars, and the winter triangle. Tune in to hear what‚Äôs up for December.
 
Planet Visibility
Mercury: Visible very low in the southeast just before sunrise during the last half of the month.
Venus: Shines brightly as the "Evening Star" in the southwest after sunset, climbing higher each evening.
Mars: Brightens significantly during December, rising in the east-northeast and visible from late evening to early morning.
Jupiter: Reaches opposition on Dec. 7, making it visible all night, rising in the east-northeast.
Saturn: Visible after sunset in the southern sky, shifting slightly westward as the month progresses.
 
Highlights
Dec. 3-5 ‚Äì Venus and the Moon: Look southwest after sunset to see a beautiful pairing. On Dec. 4, a slim crescent Moon will sit directly below Venus.
Dec. 7 ‚Äì Jupiter at Opposition: Jupiter will shine at its brightest for the year, rising in the east-northeast among Taurus's stars. Best viewed through a telescope for details like the Galilean moons and atmospheric belts.
Dec. 14 ‚Äì Jupiter, the Moon, and Aldebaran: Look for Jupiter midway between the nearly full Moon and bright orange star Aldebaran in the evening sky.
Dec. 17 ‚Äì Mars and the Moon: Mars, glowing brightly in its approach to opposition, appears super close to the waning gibbous Moon.
All Month ‚Äì Winter Triangle: Formed by Sirius, Procyon, and Betelgeuse, this asterism marks the arrival of winter skies and is a prominent feature throughout the season.
Dec. 13-14 ‚Äì Geminid Meteor Shower: The peak occurs under a nearly full Moon, reducing visibility, but bright meteors may still be spotted the week before.
Dec. 21 ‚Äì Winter Solstice: At 4:20 a.m. EST, the solstice marks the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere.

NASA astronaut Matthew Dominick reflects on his last few days on the International Space Station (@ISS) before his return, as the undocking for #Crew8 was rescheduled for no earlier than Oct. 13, due to potential impacts from Hurricane #Milton.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
‚ÄúPeering out a Dragon Endeavor window that frames red and green aurora streaming by Dragon Freedom docked to the front of the International Space Station. When Crew-9 arrived, I moved out of my crew quarters on the ISS to make room for @AstroHague.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
I now sleep in Dragon Endeavor while we wait to undock. We take most of our images from the cupola, but sleeping here has been amazing. This is the view out the window this evening. ...‚Å£
 ‚Å£
I miss my family and friends, but we would have missed today‚Äôs insane aurora if we had undocked today. I watched the aurora with Don Pettit today from the cupola and on a later pass I watched it from Endeavor with @AstroHague.‚Äù‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Image description: A window from the Dragon Endeavour, docked on the ISS, peers over Earth. A marbling of clouds is seen from below a vivid green aurora; shades of magenta hover above it in a distance. In contrast, the left half of the window is lit in blue.‚Å£

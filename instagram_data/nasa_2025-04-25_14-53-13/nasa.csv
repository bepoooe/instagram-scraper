 ‚Å£
On March 13-14, 2025, the Earth passed directly between the Sun and the Moon. Earth cast its shadow, turning the Moon‚Äôs typically gray and cratered surface red, aka a ‚ÄúBlood Moon.‚Äù‚Å£
 ‚Å£
While @NASAGlenn was looking up, @fireflyaerospace‚Äôs Blue Ghost lunar lander was looking back. Blue Ghost saw Earth block the Sun. From that perspective, this celestial event was a solar eclipse. It created a striking ‚Äúdiamond ring‚Äù effect in the sky.‚Å£

A planetary nebula located just 4,600 light-years away in the Milky Way galaxy puts on a spectacular display at the end of a giant star's life. The image itself was the final work of one of @NASAHubble's instruments: the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). First installed in 1993, the WFPC2 was replaced in 2009 by the Wide Field Camera 3 during Hubble‚Äôs final servicing mission.

The swirling, paint-like clouds in the darkness of space are clouds of ionized atoms thrown into space by a dying star. Its red giant star had exhausted its available fuel and shed its last layers of gas, enabling nuclear fusion as its compact core begins to contract further. The exposed core reaches extremely hot temperatures, radiating ultraviolet light that energizes the enormous clouds of gas cast off by the star. 

In this image, red and orange indicate nitrogen, green is hydrogen, and blue shows oxygen. The spectacle is bittersweet, as the brief phase of fusion in the core will end after only tens of thousands of years, leaving a white dwarf that will never illuminate the clouds around it again.

Image description: A glowing, jagged ring encircles a small central region of greenish clouds, making it appear like a hole torn in fabric. This ‚Äúhole‚Äù is itself encircled by a band of silvery-blue clouds and a larger, fainter, yellow ring of gas.

@NASAHubble took 13 separate exposures over 22 minutes to create this time-lapse image of tiny, potato-shaped moon Phobos (at left) orbiting around Mars. Phobos is so small that it looks like a star in these Hubble photos.‚Å£
‚Å£
This little tater is fast, though: Phobos orbits Mars in just 7 hours and 39 minutes, which is faster than Mars rotates. The moon‚Äôs orbit is very slowly shrinking, meaning it will eventually ‚Äì as in, 50 million years from now ‚Äì break up under Mars‚Äô gravitational pull, or crash onto the planet.‚Å£
‚Å£
Poor little Phobos has already been battered: it was nearly shattered by a giant impact, and has gouges from thousands of meteorite impacts.‚Å£
‚Å£
Here are a few more fun facts about Phobos:‚Å£
- It has no atmosphere.‚Å£
- It‚Äôs the larger of Mars‚Äô two moons. The other moon is called Deimos.‚Å£

The Cygnus Loop (also known as the Veil Nebula) is a supernova remnant, left over from a massive stellar explosion that occurred 5,000 to 8,000 years ago. The original supernova would have been bright enough to be seen clearly from Earth with the naked eye. At three degrees across, the Cygnus Loop is as wide as six full moons in the night sky.

On February 7, 1984, astronaut Bruce McCandless II became the first human in history to go on a spacewalk without a connection to their spacecraft. McCandless soared outside the space shuttle Challenger with the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), a propulsion device on the back of his spacesuit that used two tanks of hydrogen and 24 nozzles to move him around. 

In this iconic photo, taken by Challenger pilot Hoot Gibson, McCandless was just a few meters away from the shuttle, but further MMU flights by McCandless and astronaut Robert L. Stewart took them more than 300 feet (91 meters) into space. The MMU was used for several more flights in the 1980s.

‚Å£
Herbig-Haro objects are outflows produced by jets launched from a nearby, forming star. The outflows, which can extend for light-years, plow into a denser region of material. This creates shock waves, heating the material to higher temperatures. The material then cools by emitting light at visible and infrared wavelengths.‚Å£

The galaxy that appears, by chance, at the tip of this cosmic soft-serve is a much more distant, face-on spiral galaxy. It has a prominent central bulge represented in blue, filled with older stars. The bulge also shows hints of ‚Äúside lobes,‚Äù suggesting that this could be a barred spiral galaxy. Reddish clumps within the spiral arms show the locations of warm dust and groups of forming stars.‚Å£

Apollo 13 astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert launched from @NASAKennedy on April 11, 1970. They were headed to the Fra Mauro region of the Moon for the third lunar landing ever. Everything seemed to be going smoothly until the third day of the mission, when an oxygen tank ruptured and Swigert uttered those famous words: ‚ÄúHouston, we‚Äôve had a problem here.‚Äù

The new mission plan was to abandon the Moon landing, loop around the Moon, and get the crew home safely as quickly as possible. The crew needed to go into ‚Äúlifeboat mode,‚Äù using the lunar module Aquarius to save the spacecraft and crew. The Apollo 13 crew took this photo of the Moon from the lunar module as they passed by.

On April 17, the crew returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa. The Apollo 13 mission is sometimes called a ‚Äúsuccessful failure‚Äù: Though the crew couldn‚Äôt achieve their scientific goals, the rescue mission was a huge victory for NASA. The lessons learned from Apollo 13 were rapidly applied to the remaining Apollo missions and continue to guide us at NASA today.

 ‚Å£
About 5,550 light-years away in our galaxy, there‚Äôs a magical light show going on. This region is a cluster of clusters, containing at least three clusters of young stars, including many hot, massive, luminous stars. These hot, young stars emit radiation, which energizes the cooler gas in the cloud that surrounds them.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Astronomers call this object and others like it ‚ÄúHII‚Äù (pronounced ‚ÄúH-two‚Äù) regions. An HII region is created when the radiation from hot, young stars strips away the electrons from neutral hydrogen atoms in the surrounding gas to form clouds of ionized hydrogen, which is denoted scientifically as ‚ÄúHII.‚Äù Scientists study these areas with telescopes like @NASAChandraXray because young stars are bright in X-rays. Also, X-rays can penetrate the shrouds of gas and dust surrounding these infant stars, allowing astronomers to see how stars are formed with details that would be otherwise missed.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
This composite image contains X-ray data from our Chandra X-ray Observatory and the ROSAT telescope (purple), infrared data from our Spitzer Space Telescope (orange), and optical data from the SuperCosmos Sky Survey (blue) made by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope.‚Å£

 ‚Å£
In this image, Venus may look like a serene planet, with white and tan clouds reminding us of a cozy cup of coffee. In reality, Venus is a world of intense heat, crushing atmospheric pressure, and clouds of corrosive acid.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
The clouds seen here are comprised of sulfuric acid particles, as opposed to water droplets or ice crystals like on Earth. On top of being made of corrosive acid, these Venusian clouds whip around the planet at nearly over 200 mph (322 kph), circling the planet in about four and a half days.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
So far, we‚Äôve got acidic clouds and hurricane-force winds. Underneath the clouds lies extreme heat and pressure: Venus is hotter even than the innermost planet, Mercury. Venus‚Äô thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, giving it surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead! Finally, the surface pressure on Venus is 92 times that of Earth‚Äôs. To experience that pressure on our home planet, you‚Äôd have to dive more than 3,000 feet (915 m) into the ocean.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
So why do we study this seeming hellscape of a planet? Although it‚Äôs not currently habitable, Venus lies within the Sun‚Äôs ""Goldilocks zone,"" and may have been habitable before Earth. We want to understand how Venus became an inferno-like world when it has so many other characteristics similar to ours. Future missions like DAVINCI, VERITAS, and EnVision will seek to answer this question.‚Å£

The Veil Nebula is a pretty popular subject for study: Hubble took images of this photogenic nebula in 1994, 1997, and 2015. Each image of the Veil Nebula only captures a single moment in time, but returning to photograph it again and again lets us study and understand how the supernova remnant evolves over decades.

Because this radiant tube is pointed nearly directly at Earth, it looks more like a circle or bubble than a cylinder.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Look closely around the circle, and you may notice thread-like structures pointing toward the center. These filaments formed when a hot ""stellar wind"" of gas plowed into colder shells of dust and gas ejected previously by the small, super-hot white dwarf star at the center of this nebula.‚Å£

Exoplanets, or planets beyond our solar system, are so small that we usually detect them by measuring the effect they have on their star: they may cause the star to wobble a bit, or make it a little less bright as they pass in front of it. But our @NASAWebb telescope is so powerful that it can spot, not just distant stars, but the much smaller worlds that orbit them. 

The HR 8799 star system has long been of interest to astronomers for what it can tell us about how planets form, and Webb is giving us a better look at it than ever. Not only are we getting a direct look at these four gas giants, Webb's data tells us that these worlds are rich in carbon dioxide, suggesting that they formed similarly to Jupiter and Saturn in our home system.

 ‚Å£
When stars like the Sun enter ‚Äúretirement,‚Äù they shed their outer layers into space to create glowing clouds of gas called planetary nebulae. This ejection of mass is uneven, and planetary nebulae can have very complex shapes. The Little Gem took on the shape of a bright, enclosed central bubble with filament-like structures surrounded by a more diffuse bubble.‚Å£

Scientists believe that the stellar wind from the central star propels the outward-flowing material, sculpting the nebula‚Äôs elongated shape. As this fast wind smashes through the slower-moving cloud, it creates particularly bright blowouts at the bubble‚Äôs outer layers.‚Å£

When astronomers first studied the globular star cluster seen here in an image from @NASAHubble, they found that it appeared to be around 30% younger than other similar clusters in the Milky Way. If this cluster ‚Äì Palomar 12 ‚Äì was born in our galaxy, then it would be around the same age as other Milky Way globulars‚Ä¶ so it couldn‚Äôt be from here.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Further study revealed that Palomar 12 was actually ripped from its initial home, the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical galaxy, around 1.7 billion years ago by tidal interactions between its former home and our galaxy. The dwarf galaxy that Palomar 12 once called home is a satellite galaxy to ours, and closely orbits around us ‚Äî even occasionally passing through the plane of our galaxy.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Globular clusters like Palomar 12 can contain anywhere from tens of thousands to millions of stars, packed tightly together in dense clumps ranging from 50 to 450 light-years across. Because they contain so many stars, globular clusters are often the easiest clusters to spot in the night sky; skywatchers can see many of them with the unaided eye.‚Å£‚Å£

This trio provides abundant nutrients for the tiny aquatic organisms that paint the ocean in shades of green and blue. 

Phytoplankton bloom during the spring and summer in the South Atlantic Ocean, thriving on the long days of sunshine. The various colors represent a mix in communities as they change throughout the months-long bloom based on nutrient availability and environmental factors. 

The exact types of phytoplankton present during a bloom can be a challenge to identify with remote sensing imagery. But, thanks to our Terra satellite, researchers were able to acquire this image to get a look at how they‚Äôre blooming.

 ‚Å£‚Å£
Our Voyager 1 spacecraft took this iconic image of Earth 35 years ago. Voyager 1 was so far away ‚Äî 3.7 billion miles (6 billion km) ‚Äî from the Sun that, from its vantage point, Earth was just a point of light about a pixel in size. Truly a ‚ÄúPale Blue Dot.‚Äù‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Mission managers commanded the spacecraft to look back toward home for a final time. It snapped a series of 60 images that were used to create the first ‚Äúfamily portrait‚Äù of our solar system.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Carl Sagan was a prominent planetary scientist who was a consultant and adviser to NASA beginning in the 1950s. He also was a member of the Voyager Imaging Team. He had the original idea in 1981 to use the cameras on one of the two Voyager spacecraft to image Earth. He realized that because the spacecraft were so far away the images might not show much. This was precisely why Sagan and other members of the Voyager team felt the images were needed ‚Äî they wanted humanity to see Earth‚Äôs vulnerability and that our home world is just a tiny, fragile speck in the cosmic ocean.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
After snapping the Pale Blue Dot and other ‚Äúfamily photos,‚Äù Voyager 1 powered off its cameras forever to save its energy for the long journey ahead. In August 2012, Voyager 1 entered interstellar space. It‚Äôs now the most distant human-made object ever.‚Å£‚Å£

Voyager 2 captured this image of Saturn and two of its moons, Rhea and Dione, on July 21, 1981. In this picture, Rhea is below and to the left of Saturn, while Dione is directly below the massive planet.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Rhea looks itty-bitty in this picture, yet it‚Äôs Saturn‚Äôs second-largest moon! Rhea is small, cold, and airless - very similar to sister moons Dione, pictured here, and Tethys. How cold is Rhea? It‚Äôs as ‚Äúwarm‚Äù as -281¬∫F (-174¬∫C) in sunlit areas, ranging down to -364¬∫F (-220¬∫C) in the shade.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Rhea appeared as a tiny dot to astronomers until the Voyager (1 and 2) encounters in 1980 and 1981. The Voyager images showed that Rhea‚Äôs features could be divided into two regions: heavily cratered terrain with craters larger than 25 miles (40 kilometers) across and a second type of area in parts of the polar and equatorial region with craters less than 25 miles (40 kilometers) across. This difference may indicate there was a major resurfacing event some time in Rhea‚Äôs history.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Dione is Saturn‚Äôs fourth-largest moon. It also has terrain with varying amounts of craters, along with fractured areas that often cut through its plains and craters. These fractures suggest Dione experienced tectonic activity in its past. The fractured areas are seen in Voyager images as bright and thin wispy lines. Later, flybys by our Cassini spacecraft showed these ‚Äúwisps‚Äù as bright canyon ice walls.‚Å£

Rhea and Dione were both discovered by Giovanni Cassini, and both get their names from Greek mythology.‚Å£

Our WISE telescope captured this image, released in June 2011, of a huge complex of star-forming clouds and stellar clusters in the constellation Cygnus. Star clusters are groups of stars that share an origin, forming at roughly the same time and location, and are tied together by gravity for up to millions or even billions of years.

Different types of stars have different life spans, so clusters will change over time as stars evolve. Some clusters might contain big, hot, O-type stars. Others might hold smaller, cooler stars that age and change over billions of years. Star clusters can contain anywhere from as few as a dozen stars to upwards of millions, and those stars can be spread out over a few light-years to hundreds of light-years.

WISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) was an infrared-wavelength astronomical space telescope. It was placed into hibernation in February 2011, having completed its primary astrophysics mission. Then, in 2013, the spacecraft was assigned a new mission as NEOWISE (Near-Earth Object Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer), to help find near-Earth asteroids and comets. Its mission ended on July 31, 2024.

Recent studies show that black holes in the universe can create their own meals. Data from our @nasachandraxray Observatory and the Very Large Telescope (VLT) provide new evidence that outbursts from black holes can help cool down gas to feed themselves.
 
The centers of galaxy clusters contain the universe‚Äôs most massive galaxies, which harbor huge black holes with masses ranging from millions to tens of billions of times that of the Sun. Jets from these black holes are driven by the black holes feasting on gas.
 
The latest research supports a model where outbursts from the black holes trigger hot gas to cool and form narrow filaments of warm gas. Some of the warm gas in these filaments should then flow into the centers of the galaxies to feed the black holes, causing an outburst. The outburst causes more gas to cool and feed the black holes, leading to further outbursts - a cosmic buffet!
 
Image descriptions: A swipe-through of different galaxy clusters, each with a central black hole surrounded by patches and filaments of gas. In each image, a patch of purple with neon pink veins floats in the blackness of space, surrounded by flecks of light. At the center of each patch is a glowing, bright white dot. The bright white dots represent black holes. The purple patches represent hot X-ray gas, and the neon pink veins represent filaments of warm gas.
 
In the image of the Perseus Cluster on the left, the surrounding flecks of light are larger and brighter, making the individual galaxies they represent easier to discern. The purple gas has a blue tint, and the hot pink filaments appear solid, as if rendered with quivering strokes of a paintbrush. The Centaurus Cluster is on the right; in this image, the purple gas appears softer, with a more diffuse quality. The filaments are rendered in more detail, with feathery edges, and range in color from pale pink to neon red.

After cozying up to Venus, Jupiter, and Mars earlier this month, the Moon reaches peak illumination on Feb. 12.‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
Looking at the Moon with only your eyes, you‚Äôll see mostly areas of white and gray. The gray patches are solidified volcanic lava flows. When the Moon was young, its interior was still molten, and magma would erupt onto its surface. The lighter-colored areas are called the highlands, and show the earliest crust on the Moon, dominated by a type of rock called anorthosite.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
What you see on the Moon with just your eyes will vary depending on your eyesight. Give yourself plenty of time for your eyes to adjust and look carefully. Looking with binoculars or a telescope will reveal more details, like mountain ridges and crater chains.‚Å£‚Å£
 ‚Å£
For better viewing of craters and mountains, try phases other than the full moon. The shadows on the surface will be more pronounced, and help distinguish features you might otherwise miss.‚Å£

Released in 2019, this is the first image of a black hole and its shadow, which represents a historic feat by an international network of radio telescopes called the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). A black hole is an extremely dense object from which no light can escape. Anything that comes within a black hole‚Äôs ‚Äúevent horizon,‚Äù its point of no return, will be consumed, never to re-emerge, because of the black hole‚Äôs unimaginably strong gravity. Not unlike the Black Lodge.

In this image, you can see the shadow of the supermassive black hole in the center of Messier 87 (M87), an elliptical galaxy some 55 million light-years from Earth. This black hole is 6.5 billion times the mass of the Sun. Catching its shadow involved eight ground-based radio telescopes around the globe, operating together as if they were one telescope the size of our entire planet.

In memory of David Lynch, we will continue to explore the otherworldly and the unknown. We will focus not on the loss, but on what we gained from the years we shared this planet with you. We will see you in our dreams.

Image description: Using the Event Horizon Telescope, scientists obtained this image of the black hole at the center of galaxy M87, outlined by emission from hot gas swirling around it under the influence of strong gravity near its event horizon. The hot gas is shaped like a doughnut and is glowing a warm yellow color with reddish tint at its edges. The darkness of space is black in the background.

Journey through the darkness of space to the constellation Aquila for a spectacular light show. This nebula, around 7,200 light-years away from Earth, is a hotbed of high-mass star formation. The stars that are born here are so massive that they will eventually become supernovae. Still, as they form, they shape their surroundings: the protostar at the center of the image sends out a jet of material toward us.‚Å£‚Å£
‚Å£‚Å£
This picture was taken with @NASAHubble‚Äôs Wide Field Camera 3 as part of research that measured the extent of ionization in the jets coming from the protostar within this nebula. Ionization is the process by which atoms or molecules become charged, often because they are in such a high-energy environment that they have lost some of their electrons.‚Å£‚Å£

To answer this question, researchers used @NASAWebb to study stars in a nearby galaxy that, much like the early universe, lacks large amounts of heavy elements. The circles in the second image show the positions of the 10 stars surveyed.

Planet Visibility
Mercury: Visible very low in the southeast just before sunrise during the last half of the month.
Venus: Shines brightly as the ""Evening Star"" in the southwest after sunset, climbing higher each evening.
Mars: Brightens significantly during December, rising in the east-northeast and visible from late evening to early morning.
Jupiter: Reaches opposition on Dec. 7, making it visible all night, rising in the east-northeast.
Saturn: Visible after sunset in the southern sky, shifting slightly westward as the month progresses.
 
Highlights
Dec. 3-5 ‚Äì Venus and the Moon: Look southwest after sunset to see a beautiful pairing. On Dec. 4, a slim crescent Moon will sit directly below Venus.
Dec. 7 ‚Äì Jupiter at Opposition: Jupiter will shine at its brightest for the year, rising in the east-northeast among Taurus's stars. Best viewed through a telescope for details like the Galilean moons and atmospheric belts.
Dec. 14 ‚Äì Jupiter, the Moon, and Aldebaran: Look for Jupiter midway between the nearly full Moon and bright orange star Aldebaran in the evening sky.
Dec. 17 ‚Äì Mars and the Moon: Mars, glowing brightly in its approach to opposition, appears super close to the waning gibbous Moon.
All Month ‚Äì Winter Triangle: Formed by Sirius, Procyon, and Betelgeuse, this asterism marks the arrival of winter skies and is a prominent feature throughout the season.
Dec. 13-14 ‚Äì Geminid Meteor Shower: The peak occurs under a nearly full Moon, reducing visibility, but bright meteors may still be spotted the week before.
Dec. 21 ‚Äì Winter Solstice: At 4:20 a.m. EST, the solstice marks the beginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere.

To get a stellar view like this, Pettit took a 25-second-long exposure with an ISO (camera light sensitivity) of 3200. With a longer exposure ‚Äì that is, leaving the camera‚Äôs shutter open for a longer period of time ‚Äì more light falls on the camera‚Äôs sensor.

And we‚Äôd like to take a minute, just sit right there‚Äîand we‚Äôll tell you how we‚Äôre helping people travel through air.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
NASA photographer Jim Ross took this photo from our F-18 Hornet aircraft during an unrestricted climb over Rogers Dry Lake near NASA‚Äôs Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. The F-18 is used for research and proficiency required of all NASA pilots.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Today, every U.S. commercial aircraft and air traffic control facility incorporates NASA-developed technology. That heritage continues as our efforts help safely and sustainably transform aviation for the 21st century. Armstrong is our primary center for high-risk, atmospheric flight research and test projects, with access to 301,000 acres of remote land, year-round flying weather, and the Bell X-1 Supersonic Corridor.‚Å£

But it may still be a galaxy. This sparkling field is Abell 2125, a galaxy cluster located 3 billion light-years away from us in the Ursa Minor constellation. Each golden yellow dot you see is an individual galaxy, captured in visible light by the Kitt Peak National Observatory. The purple dots and haze are gas clouds seen in X-ray light by @NASAChandraXray. X-rays are not part of the visible light spectrum, so they've been translated into color we can see in this image.
 
It takes billions of years to build a massive galaxy cluster like Abell 2125, which may contain thousands of galaxies. Since it‚Äôs so far away, this cluster also gives us insight into the early stages of galaxy cluster development, as well as the effects on galaxies within it. For example, data from Chandra, @NASAHubble, and the Very Large Array show that several galaxies in Abell 2125 are being stripped of their gas as they fall through hot, high-pressure clouds.
 
Image description: This entire image is covered with purple and gold dots. Slightly above center is the largest and brightest dot, a galaxy with four diffraction spikes. Throughout the image, but especially at upper left and bottom right, are purple clouds of gas that you can see through.

The colorful supernova remnant DEM L 190 resembles a cosmic flaming marshmallow as it billows across the screen in this image captured by @NASAHubble. Located approximately 160,000 light-years away from Earth, these delicate sheets and intricate filaments are debris from the death of a massive star that once lived in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way.‚Å£

 ‚Å£
Thankfully, you don‚Äôt need to do either to see this sideways discovery. NASA researchers found that the black hole within the galaxy NGC 5084 is ‚Äútipped over!‚Äù The dark vertical line at the center of this image is a disk of dust that orbits the galaxy‚Äôs core. The disk‚Äôs presence implies that there‚Äôs a supermassive black hole there that also has a vertical orientation.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Astronomers at @NASAAmes used new techniques to study legacy data from @nasachandraxray and found four long plumes of plasma ‚Äì hot, charged gas ‚Äì emanating from NGC 5084. Hot gas plumes are not often spotted in galaxies, and typically only one or two are present. The surprising second set of plumes was a strong clue this galaxy housed a supermassive black hole, but there could have been other explanations.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
What they saw in the Chandra data seemed so strange that they immediately looked to confirm it, digging into the data archives of other telescopes and requesting new observations from two powerful ground-based observatories. They found this @NASAHubble image with the vertical dusty disk, which also suggested the presence of a black hole there, and that the black hole had a vertical orientation compared to the galaxy.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
We don‚Äôt yet know why this galaxy‚Äôs black hole has such an unusual orientation, but some possible explanations are a collision with another galaxy or the formation of a chimney of superheated gas breaking out of the top and bottom of the galactic plane.‚Å£

This image shows off Venus, Earth‚Äôs fiery twin, as mapped by more than a decade of radar investigations‚Äîconcluding with the 1990-1994 Magellan mission. The colors you see here represent different elevations, bringing out the fine details of the planet‚Äôs rugged surface.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Magellan was the first spacecraft to map the entire surface of Venus, making many scientific discoveries. For example, the mission found that at least 85% of Venus‚Äôs surface is covered with volcanic flows.‚Å£
 ‚Å£
Despite the high surface temperatures (887¬∫F or 475¬∫C) and high atmospheric pressures (92 atmospheres), the complete lack of water makes erosion on Venus an extremely slow process. As a result, surface features can hang around for hundreds of millions of years. Magellan burned up about 10 hours after being commanded to plunge into the Venusian atmosphere.‚Å£

3509340932965430921,Sidecar,DCzrvw5JHaJ,"Hats off to you!This new infrared image from @NASAWebb shows off bespoke details in the Sombrero galaxy, a hat-like formation around 30 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Virgo.When previously imaged by @NASAHubble in visible light, the core of the galaxy shone bright, obscuring the inner disk, but here, we can see that the inner disk is smooth. Webb‚Äôs new view also reveals that the outer ring is made of intricate clumps of dust. Researchers say the clumpy nature of the dust can indicate the presence of young star-forming regions.We usually feature rather turbulent parts of the universe, but the Sombrero galaxy is rather peaceful in comparison. It‚Äôs not particularly active in terms of star creation: it produces less than one solar mass of stars per year, in comparison to the Milky Way‚Äôs roughly two solar masses a year. Even the supermassive black hole at the center of the Sombrero galaxy is rather docile. It‚Äôs classified as a low luminosity active galactic nucleus, slowly snacking on infalling material from the galaxy while sending off a bright, relatively small, jet.Image description: A wide view of the Sombrero galaxy is split into three slides. Seen edge-on, it looks like a flat blue disk at an angle. In the first slide, the clumps of dust that make up the outer ring take center stage. On the second slide, the bright core and smooth inner ring are visible. Finally, the lumpy outer ring reappears in slide three. On each slide, distant galaxies dot the background, appearing as multicolored dots in the darkness of space. This image includes filters representing 7.7-micron light as blue, 11.3-micron light as green, and 12.8-micron light as red.Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STSci#NASA #Webb #Galaxy #Hubble #Hat #Sombrero #Space #Astrophotography",1827,773357,2024-11-25T20:21:01.000Z,nasa,https://www.instagram.com/p/DCzrvw5JHaJ/

This glittering cluster of 3,000 stars is known as Westerlund 2, named for the Swedish astronomer, Bengt Westerlund, who discovered it. This star cluster is between 6 to 13 light-years across, and is ""only"" about 2 million years old‚Äîa very long time for us, but a blink of an eye for a star. 

Because this star cluster is so young, many of its stars have not yet ignited the hydrogen in their cores; the red dots scattered throughout this image are newly-forming stars, still wrapped in their gas-and-dust cocoons. Westerlund 2 is about 20,000 light-years from Earth, visible in the constellation Carina.

Image description: A bright arc of multicolored gas, in shades ranging from orange and red to blue and purple, sweeps across the left and bottom of this cosmic image. Within the arc, countless bright red stars are clumped closely together, with other blue and red stars scattered throughout the image.

In April 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope revealed the shadow of a supermassive black hole in the elliptical galaxy M87‚Äîthe first time such an image had been captured. Astronomers have studied M87 for centuries, in part due to a spectacular jet of high-energy material streaming from its center. This video zooms in on M87 with visible, X-ray, and radio images, ending on the historic image from 2019.
